# alchemy documentation index

Answer the Alchemy question in `$ARGUMENTS` (or, if empty, the request that
triggered this skill) using the indexed corpus below. All paths are relative to
this skill's directory.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: corpus-stats -->

Indexed from `alchemy-run/alchemy` @ `808ef69` (2026-08-30), alchemy `2.0.0-beta.75`: **330 topic files** across 23 areas.

Reference paths mirror site URLs exactly, so a path is derivable without
searching: `https://alchemy.run/cloudflare/compute/workers` ->
`references/cloudflare/compute/workers.md`. A section landing page is
`_overview.md` (`https://alchemy.run/cli` -> `references/cli/_overview.md`).

## Task

1. **Classify** the question against the routing tables below.
2. **Read** at most **1-3** topic files. Prefer one exact file over many.
3. **Answer** with concrete TypeScript, using exact symbol names.
4. **Cite** each reference file you used by path.

If _Core mental model_ or _Command surface_ already covers it, answer directly
and read nothing.

## Core mental model

- **`Alchemy.Stack(name, { providers, state }, effect)`** is the deploy unit.
  `providers` and `state` are both required; the `Effect.gen`'s return value is
  the stack output. It is `export default`ed. `alchemy.run.ts` is only the CLI's
  default lookup, so any file with a default-exported Stack works as `[file]`.
- **Resource.** The first constructor argument is the **logical ID** you choose.
  The physical name is derived as `{stack}-{stage}-{logicalId}-{instanceId}`.
  The instance ID is stable across create/update/delete and changes only on
  replacement, which is what makes creates idempotent. A resource declaration is
  **inert until a Stack `yield*`s it**, so declaring one at module scope and
  importing it deploys nothing.
- **`Output<T>`** is the lazy typed reference. Property access returns another
  Output (`bucket.bucketName` is `Output<string>`), and passing one into another
  resource's props is what registers the dependency edge that orders the deploy.
  Operators: `Output.all`, `` Output.interpolate`...` ``,
  `output.pipe(Output.map(fn))`, `Output.mapEffect`, `Output.literal`,
  `Output.fromEffect`, `Output.ref`. `Redacted<T>` survives evaluation and prints
  as `<redacted>`.
- **Bindings are the thing that makes v2 different from prop-passing IaC.**
  `yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(Bucket)` hands back a typed SDK client.
  There is no `env.BUCKET` and no hand-written IAM. A binding has two halves: the
  **contract** (a `Binding.Service`, a callable Context tag) and an
  interchangeable **implementation Layer** supplied with `Effect.provide`:
  `*Binding` (native platform binding), `*Http` (deploy-time scoped token plus
  HTTP at runtime), `*Local` (deploy-time client reusing the CLI's credentials,
  for use inside Actions). Same contract, same handler code. Bindings are also
  the only mechanism that expresses **circular references**; plain Output props
  form a DAG.
- **Providers** teach Alchemy a resource type and are Effect Layers:
  `Cloudflare.providers()`, `AWS.providers()`, `Layer.mergeAll(...)`. Declaring a
  resource whose provider layer is missing is a **type error**.
- **Lifecycle:** Diff, Read, Pre-Create, Reconcile (used for both create and
  update), Delete (must be idempotent). On a resource with no prior state the
  engine calls `read`: `undefined` means create, plain attrs means silent adopt
  (state recovery), `Unowned(attrs)` fails unless `--adopt`.
- **Actions** are graph nodes with no provider lifecycle: no replace, read, or
  delete. Only run (`λ`) or skip (`·`), decided by a SHA-256 of the resolved
  input against the persisted `inputHash`. `deploy --force` flips every skip to
  run. Use them for seeding, migrations, and cache invalidation.
- **State** persists by FQN, scoped by stack name and stage:
  `Alchemy.localState()` (`.alchemy/` on disk), `Cloudflare.state()` (Worker plus
  Durable Object), `AWS.state()` (S3). **Stage** is an isolated instance of a
  Stack (default `dev_$USER`) with its own state and physical names.

### The two phases

Function-shaped resources (Worker, Lambda, Durable Object, Workflow, Container,
ECS Task, Fly/Railway/Hetzner Service) express both phases in one program by
returning an Effect from inside an Effect:

- The **outer `Effect.gen` is the init phase.** It runs at plantime to discover
  and record bindings, and _again at cold start_ inside the deployed handler,
  where the same calls return live SDK clients. Bind what you need, return what
  you expose.
- The **returned handlers are the runtime phase** (`fetch` plus any RPC methods),
  running per request and never at plantime.
- `Alchemy.RuntimeContext` exists only in the runtime closure. Requiring it
  outside a handler is a compile error.
- `ALCHEMY_PHASE` is `plan` or `runtime`. `alchemy dev` is a **plantime** phase,
  so read the `ALCHEMY_DEV` config key to detect dev specifically.
- Two lifetimes: instance scope (once per isolate) and request scope (per event).
  **Build at instance scope, acquire at request scope**, because instance
  finalizers never run on workerd.

Effect style is optional. **Async style** keeps a plain `async fetch(request,
env)` handler, declares bindings on the resource's `env` prop, and types `env`
with `Cloudflare.InferEnv<typeof Worker>`. Both styles share providers, CLI, and
artifact.

## Canonical shapes

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  { providers: Cloudflare.providers(), state: Cloudflare.state() },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Bucket");
    return { bucketName: bucket.bucketName };
  }),
);
```

```typescript
// src/worker.ts -- init phase binds, runtime phase serves
export default Cloudflare.Worker(
  "Api",
  { main: import.meta.url },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(Bucket);
    return {
      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
        const obj = yield* bucket.get("hello.txt");
        return obj
          ? HttpServerResponse.text(yield* obj.text())
          : HttpServerResponse.text("Not found", { status: 404 });
      }),
    };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucketBinding)),
);
```

The class form adds RPC methods and a nominal type; the `<Greeter>` self
reference and the empty `()` are required ceremony:

```typescript
export default class Greeter extends Cloudflare.Worker<Greeter>()(
  "Greeter",
  { main: import.meta.url },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    return { greet: (name: string) => Effect.succeed(`hello ${name}`) };
  }),
) {}
```

## Command surface

`bun alchemy <command> [file] [options]`. `[file]` defaults to `alchemy.run.ts`
and must exist. Nearly every command takes `--stage`, `--profile`, `--env-file`,
and `--yes`.

| Command                                                     | Purpose                                            | Flags that matter                                            |

| `plan [file]`                                               | preview only; same code path as `deploy --dry-run` | `--stage`                                                    |
| `destroy [file]`                                            | delete this stack and stage in dependency order    | `--dry-run`, `--yes`                                         |
| `unsafe nuke [file]`                                        | delete everything each provider can `list()`       | `--dry-run`, `--include`, `--exclude`, `--filter`, `--local` |
| `dev [file]`                                                | hot-reloading loop; implies `--yes` and dev mode   | `--force`                                                    |
| `tail` / `logs [file]`                                      | stream live logs / fetch past entries              | `--filter <ids>`, `--limit`, `--since`                       |
| `login [file]`                                              | authenticate every provider in the stack           | `--configure`                                                |
| `profile show\|clear`                                       | inspect or wipe `~/.alchemy/profiles.json`         | `--profile`                                                  |
| `state stacks\|stages\|resources\|get\|export\|tree\|clear` | inspect and manage state                           | `--stack`, `--stage`, `--fqn`, `--local`                     |
| `aws bootstrap`                                             | per-account assets bucket that Lambda needs        | `--region`, `--destroy`                                      |
| `cloudflare bootstrap\|create-token\|state logs`            | state-store worker, API tokens, its logs           | `--force`, `--all-permissions`                               |

Plan symbols: `+` create, `~` update, `-` delete, `·` no-op, `λ` action run.

`deploy`, `destroy`, and `plan` render an Ink TUI interactively. A known agent
env var (including `CLAUDECODE`) forces plain output, and **plain mode never
prompts and makes no changes**, so always pass `--yes` when running these
yourself.

### Routing judgment

**Compute target.** Cloudflare Worker is the documented default for that hub;
Durable Objects for globally-unique stateful instances and WebSockets,
Containers for long-lived or arbitrary runtimes, Workflows for durable
checkpointed jobs. On AWS, "choose Lambda unless you have a specific reason not
to"; ECS when the workload is long-running, exceeds 15 minutes, or is already a
container; EKS only when you want Kubernetes itself; EC2 when you need the
machine. Fly, Railway, and Hetzner all bundle an Effect program as a Service,
with no Dockerfile.

**SQL and databases.** `sql/effect-sql/*` for tagged-template SQL with typed
errors and no ORM; `sql/drizzle/*` for a typed schema and relational queries
(both wrap the same `@effect/sql` drivers). `prisma` is a hosting provider, not a
third ORM choice on that axis. For the store itself: D1 when SQLite is enough,
Neon for Postgres with copy-on-write branching per preview stage, PlanetScale for
branch-per-PR on Vitess MySQL or managed Postgres, RDS/Aurora when already on
AWS. **Hyperdrive is the pooler, not the database**: Neon, PlanetScale, or RDS
goes behind it.

**API modality.** `apis/schemaless` is the default for anything internal (Worker
to Worker, Worker to Durable Object); the client type _is_ the class you bound,
with no schema and no runtime validation. Use `apis/effect-rpc` when data crosses
a trust boundary and the consumer is Effect/TypeScript, and `apis/effect-http`
when the consumer is neither and wants real URLs and `curl`. The docs explicitly
discourage the schema'd modalities for internal calls.

**Pages whose filename does not give them away:**

- bindings concept -> `references/infrastructure-as-effects/binding.md`; the
  Worker-facing walkthrough is `functions-and-servers.md` in the same area
- env vars and secrets -> `references/environments/secrets.md` (the
  `effect/Config` integration), then `<cloud>/security/secrets-env.md`
- credentials rather than secrets -> `references/environments/profiles.md`.
  Profiles control _how alchemy authenticates_; stages control _what is deployed_
- local dev -> `references/environments/local-development.md`, then
  `references/<cloud>/local-development.md`
- CI and PR previews -> `references/environments/ci.md`
- cross-stack wiring -> `references/infrastructure-as-code/references.md`
- renaming without replacing -> `references/infrastructure-as-code/renaming.md`
- taking over existing infrastructure -> `references/cli/adopting-resources.md`
- deploy-time scripts -> `references/infrastructure-as-code/action.md`
- a new cloud or third-party API ->
  `references/infrastructure-as-code/custom-provider.md`

### Per-resource API reference

The corpus has no page for most individual resources. The generated reference is
not in the repo, but it is served as raw markdown:

```
https://alchemy.run/providers/<cloud>/<service>/<resource>.md
```

for example `/providers/cloudflare/r2/bucket.md`. Fetch that for exact props on a
resource the corpus only mentions in passing. Never invent option keys for one
from the conceptual pages.

## Traps

- **Resolving a `Config` only inside `fetch` binds nothing.** Bindings are
  discovered by running the init phase, and `fetch` never runs at deploy time.
  Resolve `Config` in the outer `Effect.gen`. The docs label this a footgun.
- **Changing a logical ID silently plans a replacement**, deleting the old
  physical resource and its data. Use `Alchemy.renamedFrom("OldId")`, listing
  former IDs most recent first.
- **v1 to v2 is not state-compatible.** v2 starts from an empty state store, so
  the first deploy creates duplicates. Pin `name` to v1's derived
  `{app}-{id}-{stage}` and run `deploy --adopt`. Then never run `destroy` in the
  v1 project, since its state still points at the same physical resources.
  Renames: `entrypoint` -> `main`, `bindings` -> `env`, `await` -> `yield*`.
- **`main: import.meta.url` vs `main: "./src/worker.ts"`** is the Effect vs async
  fork. `import.meta.url` means "this file is its own entrypoint". Omitting
  `main` deploys an assets-only Worker.
- **Acquiring a disposable at instance scope leaks**, because workerd isolates
  are evicted with no teardown hook. Acquire per event.
- **A binding Layer the host cannot satisfy is a compile error**, such as
  `Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucketBinding` on an `AWS.Lambda.Function`.
- **`alchemy unsafe nuke` is not scoped to a stack, a stage, or the state
  store.** It deletes everything each registered provider's `list()` returns in
  the ambient account, including resources Alchemy never created. It is hidden
  from `--help` specifically so agents do not discover it. Do not suggest it
  casually. `--filter` **spares** on truthy.
- **`retain` protects from Alchemy, not from the provider's cascade**, and must
  be set before the deploy that would remove the resource.
- **Moving a resource between local and live is a replacement**, not an update.
- **References fail fast.** Deploy the owner stage first, destroy in reverse.
- **Actions are not idempotent for free**; the body must tolerate retries.
- **R2 refuses to delete a non-empty bucket** unless `forceDestroy: true`.

## Version notes

Alchemy v2 is **pre-release** and moving fast. Effect is pinned to a release
candidate (`effect@rc`, the Effect 4.0 dist-tag), so module paths such as
`effect/unstable/http/HttpServerResponse` are current but will move when Effect 4
stabilizes. Drizzle is pinned to an exact prerelease build
(`drizzle-orm@1.0.0-rc.5-ab785fc`); do not suggest `drizzle-orm@latest`. Node
floor is 22+, Bun recommended.

The stage resolution chain is documented inconsistently: prefer
`references/environments/stages.md` over `references/cli/_overview.md`, and treat
the exact stage-name regex as unsettled.

## Rules

- The corpus is a point-in-time snapshot of a beta. If it does not cover
  something, say so plainly rather than inventing an API.
- Symbol names are exact and case-sensitive. Quote them verbatim; never guess an
  export that is not in the file you read.
- Read the specific topic file, not an `INDEX.md`, once routing is clear.
  `INDEX.md` files are for disambiguation only.
- Each reference file's header carries its upstream URL. Cite that when pointing
  the user at official docs.
- Release notes are deliberately not indexed. For "when did X change", point at
  https://alchemy.run/blog.
- Refresh the corpus from upstream: `bun $SKILL_DIR/scripts/build-skill.ts`
  (`--check` to verify freshness, `--ref <sha>` to pin).

## Output

Lead with the TypeScript that answers the question, then explain the symbols
used, then list the reference file paths consulted.

# IPs & certificates

> Reach a Fly Service over fly.dev and on your own hostname.

IPs and certificates attach to the [App](/fly/compute/apps). The
[Service](/fly/compute/services) publishes ports. Fly's proxy
load-balances `{app}.fly.dev` across Machines that publish a proxy
service.

## Publish the Service

A Service with `port` listens inside the Machine. Alchemy publishes
HTTP 80 and HTTPS 443 on the Fly proxy in front of it.

```typescript
export default class Api extends Fly.Service<Api>()(
  "Api",
  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url, region: "iad", port: 3000 },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    return {
      fetch: Effect.succeed(HttpServerResponse.text("hello")),
    };
  }),
) {}
```

Yield the Service in the Stack. `api.url` is
`https://{appName}.fly.dev`.

```typescript
export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  { providers: Fly.providers(), state: Alchemy.localState() },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const api = yield* Api;
    return { url: api.url };
  }),
);
```

That hostname does not answer over IPv4 yet.

## Allocate a shared IPv4

Add a shared Anycast IPv4 on the same App. This is what you want for
fly.dev over IPv4. It is free.

```typescript
export const PublicIp = Fly.IpAssignment("Shared", {
  app: Site,
  type: "shared_v4",
});
```

Yield it next to the Service.

```diff lang="typescript"
Effect.gen(function* () {
  const api = yield* Api;
+  const ip = yield* PublicIp;
  return { url: api.url, ip: ip.ip };
}),
```

`v6` is free dedicated IPv6. `v4` is billed dedicated IPv4 and may
400 if the org has no quota. Prefer `shared_v4` or `v6` in tests.

Fly's proxy terminates TLS on 443. The Service still listens on
`port` inside the Machine.

## Use your own hostname

A Certificate covers a hostname on the App. Default `kind` is
`"acme"` (Let's Encrypt). The Service does not change.

```typescript
export const V6 = Fly.IpAssignment("V6", {
  app: Site,
  type: "v6",
});

export const Www = Fly.Certificate("Www", {
  app: Site,
  hostname: "www.example.com",
  kind: "acme",
});
```

Yield `Www` in the Stack. Point DNS at the App. An A record for
`www` to `PublicIp.ip`. An AAAA record to `V6.ip`. Plus whatever
`Www.dnsRequirements` lists for the ACME challenge.

Fly's proxy terminates TLS on 443 once the certificate is
`configured`.

`"custom"` uploads a PEM (`fullchain` + `privateKey`). Hostname is
the identity. Changing `app`, `hostname`, or `kind` replaces.

## Issue a certificate independently

Use `alchemy/ACME` when you want to choose the certificate authority or
issue a wildcard with DNS-01. The account and certificate are independent
of Fly; this example uploads the result to a Fly App.

```typescript
import * as ACME from "alchemy/ACME";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Fly from "alchemy/Fly";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";

const providers = Layer.mergeAll(
  ACME.providers(),
  Cloudflare.providers(),
  Fly.providers(),
);
```

Use `providers` in the Stack configuration. Inside the Stack's Effect,
resolve your existing Cloudflare `Zone` and Fly `Site`, then issue and upload:

```typescript
const zone = yield* Zone;
const site = yield* Site;
const account = yield* ACME.Account("LetsEncrypt", {
  ca: ACME.LetsEncrypt,
  contact: ["mailto:ops@example.com"],
  termsOfServiceAgreed: true,
});
const certificate = yield* ACME.Certificate("Wildcard", {
  account,
  identifiers: ["*.example.com"],
  solver: Cloudflare.DNS.AcmeSolver(zone),
});
yield* Fly.Certificate("WildcardUpload", {
  app: site,
  hostname: "*.example.com",
  kind: "custom",
  fullchain: certificate.chain,
  privateKey: certificate.privateKey,
});
```

The DNS solver publishes and removes the challenge TXT records. Cloudflare's
solver waits 60 seconds before validation so cached challenge values can expire.
Start with `ACME.LetsEncryptStaging` while developing; its certificates are not
trusted by browsers.

Renewal is evaluated when you deploy, with a default threshold of 30 days before
expiry. Schedule deployments if you need automatic renewal. Account and
certificate private keys are persisted in stack state as redacted values;
protect the state backend as secret material. Redaction alone is not encryption.

## Manage certificates at runtime

A Service can bind `Fly.WriteCertificates(Site)` to request, upload, inspect,
check, and remove certificates without redeploying. Provide
`Fly.WriteCertificatesHttp` on the Service Effect. For runtime issuance,
`ACME.IssueCertificate` and `ACME.IssueCertificateHttp` bind an existing account;
pass a runtime DNS solver to each issuance call.

Runtime operations do not become stack resources. Your application owns renewal
scheduling, revocation, and removal of certificates it creates this way. Verify
that the chosen certificate authority is reachable from your runtime.

Follow [Runtime issuance](/acme/runtime) for an authenticated Worker example,
[Using certificates](/acme/using-certificates) for Fly uploads, and
[Renewal & revocation](/acme/renewal) for scheduling and deletion policies.
The [`IssueCertificate`](/providers/acme/issuecertificate) and
[`WriteCertificates`](/providers/fly/writecertificates) references document the
binding methods.

## Where next

The [tutorial](/fly/tutorial/part-2) allocates `shared_v4` so
fly.dev answers. IPs and certificates hang off the
[App](/fly/compute/apps). See the
[`IpAssignment`](/providers/fly/ipassignment) and
[`Certificate`](/providers/fly/certificate) references.

# Services

> An Effect program running in a Fly Machine. Scale it with count.

A [`Service`](/providers/fly/service) is an Effect program running
in a Fly.io [Machine](/fly/compute/machines). Set `count` to scale
it up or down. Several Services share one
[App](/fly/compute/apps).

## Declare a Service

A Service is a class. Props describe the Machine. The Effect is the
program that runs on it.

```typescript
// src/api.ts
import * as Fly from "alchemy/Fly";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import { Site } from "./app.ts";

export default class Api extends Fly.Service<Api>()(
  "Api",
  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    return {};
  }),
) {}
```

`app` is the parent [App](/fly/compute/apps). Pass the declaration
directly, yielded or module-scope. Changing `app` replaces the
Service.

`main: import.meta.url` is the bundle entrypoint. Alchemy bundles
this file with Rolldown, builds a Docker image (default
`node:26-slim`), and pushes it to
`registry.fly.io/{app}:{id}-{hash}`.

## Serve HTTP with `fetch`

Return `fetch` from the constructor Effect to boot an HTTP server.

```diff lang="typescript"
import * as Fly from "alchemy/Fly";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
+import * as HttpServerResponse from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerResponse";
import { Site } from "./app.ts";

export default class Api extends Fly.Service<Api>()(
  "Api",
  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
-    return {};
+    return {
+      fetch: Effect.succeed(HttpServerResponse.text("hello")),
+    };
  }),
) {}
```

Omit `fetch` for a [background service](#background-services).

## Pin a region

Fly Machines live in a [region](/fly/compute/regions). The default
is `iad`. Changing `region` replaces the Service.

```diff lang="typescript"
export default class Api extends Fly.Service<Api>()(
  "Api",
-  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url },
+  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url, region: "iad" },
```

## Set the port

`port` is the port the process listens on inside the Machine.
Alchemy writes it to `PORT`. Default `3000`.

```diff lang="typescript"
export default class Api extends Fly.Service<Api>()(
  "Api",
-  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url, region: "iad" },
+  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url, region: "iad", port: 3000 },
```

## The public URL

Yield the Service in the Stack. `api.url` is
`https://{appName}.fly.dev`. Alchemy does not create this hostname.
It is the parent [App](/fly/compute/apps)'s fly.dev name. The
Service does not get its own URL.

```typescript
export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  { providers: Fly.providers(), state: Alchemy.localState() },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const api = yield* Api;
    return { url: api.url };
  }),
);
```

`url` is `undefined` when you pass `services: []`.

:::note[One fly.dev hostname per App]
Every published Service on the App shares `{appName}.fly.dev`. Put
one public Service on an App. Use `services: []` for workers.
:::

## Fly's proxy is the load balancer

There is no LoadBalancer resource. Fly runs an Anycast proxy at the
edge. Unless you override `services`, Alchemy publishes HTTP 80 and
HTTPS 443 on that proxy and points them at `port` inside each
Machine.

A request to `https://{appName}.fly.dev` lands on Fly's edge. Fly
terminates TLS on 443, picks one started Machine that published this
service, and forwards to `port` where `fetch` runs.

## An address so it answers

`{app}.fly.dev` does not answer over IPv4 until the App has an
[`IpAssignment`](/fly/networking). Allocate a shared Anycast IPv4
on the same App and yield it next to the Service.

```typescript
export const PublicIp = Fly.IpAssignment("Shared", {
  app: Site,
  type: "shared_v4",
});
```

```diff lang="typescript"
Effect.gen(function* () {
  const api = yield* Api;
+  const ip = yield* PublicIp;
  return { url: api.url, ip: ip.ip };
}),
```

## Scale with `count`

`count` is how many Machines to provision. Default `1`. They all
publish the same proxy service behind `{app}.fly.dev`. Fly's proxy
picks an available Machine per request. With `autostop: "stop"` or
`"suspend"`, some provisioned replicas can be idle; `count` is not a
promise that every process is continuously running. Use `autostart`
and `minMachinesRunning` for Fly's wake-up and minimum-capacity behavior.
See [idle capacity during replacement](/fly/compute/deployments#keep-idle-capacity-with-stop-or-suspend).

Each replica gets its own Volume from every
[`MountVolume`](/fly/data/volumes) binding. Volume-backed Services use
rolling updates; blue/green does not clone or share those volumes.

```diff lang="typescript"
export default class Api extends Fly.Service<Api>()(
  "Api",
-  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url, region: "iad", port: 3000 },
+  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url, region: "iad", count: 3, port: 3000 },
```

## What a deploy does

Docker must be running.

Alchemy bundles `main` with Rolldown. If the hash matches the last
deploy, it skips build and push. Otherwise it builds `linux/amd64`
from `image` (default `node:26-slim`) and pushes to
`registry.fly.io/{app}:{id}-{hash}`. With the default rolling policy,
it creates or updates replicas sequentially. For each Machine it starts,
reconcile waits for configured readiness checks before proceeding.

By default, changed code produces a new image and an in-place Machine update.
Unchanged desired inputs are a no-op. Opt into `deploy: { strategy: "bluegreen" }` to
[prepare healthy replacements before retiring the old generation](/fly/compute/deployments).
Keep one Service declaration. Alchemy manages both generations and uses the
old Machine's shutdown policy when retiring it. The guide explains readiness,
traffic overlap, Effect finalizers, idle capacity, and recovery. Raw images and
external servers must handle their own shutdown.

Override the base image with `image` (must still run Node). Pass
`services: []` for a process that should not be published.

:::note[Deploy waits for Fly service checks]
If a Machine has service checks (the default TCP check, or your HTTP
checks), reconcile waits until Fly reports them `passing` before it
moves on to the next replica. `started` only means the VM booted.
The default readiness budget is 60 seconds; set `deploy.healthTimeout`
for a longer bounded wait. If checks do not pass, deployment fails with
`Fly.ReplicaChecksNotPassing`, including the last observed check
results, and later replicas remain unchanged. Earlier updates are
not automatically rolled back.

Omitting `/health` does not fail the deploy unless you configured an
HTTP check on that path. A single replica still updates in place and
can be unavailable during deployment; this is not blue/green deployment.
:::

## Config

Yield `Config` in the constructor. Alchemy reads the value from the env of
whoever deploys and writes it onto the Machine. Do not pass
`env: { ... }` on a Service.

```typescript
import * as Config from "effect/Config";
import * as Redacted from "effect/Redacted";

export default class Api extends Fly.Service<Api>()(
  "Api",
  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url, port: 3000 },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const apiKey = yield* Config.Redacted("API_KEY");

    return {
      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
        const token = Redacted.value(apiKey);
        // ...
      }),
    };
  }),
) {}
```

`Config.Redacted("API_KEY")` is `Redacted<string>`. Unwrap with
`Redacted.value` only where you need the raw string.

Alchemy also injects `PORT` (when `port` is set) and stack metadata.
For a secret Fly should own and inject into every Machine on the
App, use [`Fly.Secret`](/fly/data/secrets).

Service-bound secret preparation establishes a required version floor for
replacement Machines, not a snapshot of the App vault. Standalone secrets,
other Services, and runtime writers are not serialized by Machine leases.
An out-of-band secret update alone does not guarantee a new rollout; use
an explicit desired-input change when rotation requires replacement.
See [rotating secrets with your application](/fly/compute/deployments#rotate-secrets-with-your-application).

## Background services

Omit `fetch` and pass `services: []` so Fly does not publish a proxy.
Return a `run` Effect for a long-running loop:

```typescript
// src/worker.ts
import * as Fly from "alchemy/Fly";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import { Site } from "./app.ts";

export default class Worker extends Fly.Service<Worker>()(
  "Worker",
  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url, region: "iad", services: [] },
  Effect.succeed({ run: Effect.never }),
) {}
```

`Effect.never` above only keeps the example alive. Acquire queue connections
and start real consumers inside `run`, not during the outer initialization
Effect that also participates in planning. You can return both `fetch` and
`run` for mixed HTTP and background work.

For blue/green, a private worker also needs a named readiness check and a real
server to answer it. A `run`-only program does not create a readiness endpoint.
Cordoning controls proxy traffic, not job acquisition; both generations can
consume work before promotion.

With blue/green or explicit `shutdown`, the managed bootstrap initiates runtime
cleanup on SIGTERM/SIGINT while HTTP requests and shared dependencies remain
alive. The application owns its stop-acquisition barrier and bounded job drain.
Use ordinary finalizers and a separately owned work scope for jobs that must
survive worker-loop interruption; no new public shutdown hook is required.
See the [queue worker cleanup example](/fly/compute/deployments#close-your-queue-worker-on-shutdown).

Fly's restart policy controls what happens when the process exits. Suspension
is not ordinary process shutdown, so it is not a promise that finalizers run.

## Multiple Services, one App

Each Service has its own Machines, image, env, and lifecycle. Point
several at the same `app`.

```typescript
class Api extends Fly.Service<Api>()(
  "Api",
  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url, port: 3000 },
  /* HTTP */
) {}

class Worker extends Fly.Service<Worker>()(
  "Worker",
  { app: Site, main: import.meta.url, services: [] },
  /* mounts a disk, writes files */
) {}
```

A Volume attaches to one Machine. `MountVolume` with `count: 3`
creates three disks.

## Logs

Machine logs live in the Fly dashboard and `fly logs`. `alchemy
logs` (including `--tail`) doesn't support Fly Services yet.

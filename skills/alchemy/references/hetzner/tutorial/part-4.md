# Part 4: Networking & Load Balancing

> Put your Service behind a managed Load Balancer on a private network, and lock the Server down with a Firewall.

Right now your Service is served straight off the Server's public
IP, and every port on the Server is open to the internet. In this
final part you'll make it production-shaped: a **private Network**
between the machines, a managed **Load Balancer** in front, and a
**Firewall** that closes the app port to everyone but the LB.

:::note[Costs]
The `lb11` Load Balancer costs about €5.39/month, billed hourly like
everything else. The [cleanup step](#clean-up) at the end tears it
all down.
:::

## Create a private Network

Add a Network to `src/server.ts` and attach the Server to it:

```diff lang="typescript"
// src/server.ts
import * as Hetzner from "alchemy/Hetzner";

+export const Net = Hetzner.Network("net", {
+  ipRange: "10.0.0.0/16",
+  subnets: [
+    { type: "cloud", networkZone: "eu-central", ipRange: "10.0.1.0/24" },
+  ],
+});

export const Box = Hetzner.Server("box", {
  serverType: "cx22",
  image: "ubuntu-24.04",
  location: "nbg1",
  sshKeys: [Key],
+  networks: [Net],
});

export const Data = Hetzner.Volume("data", { /* ... */ });
```

`nbg1` lives in the `eu-central` network zone. Passing `Net` — a
module-scope resource declaration — directly in `networks` is
enough: resource-valued props accept the resource or an Effect
producing it, and Alchemy resolves the reference and orders the
deploy.

## Add a Load Balancer

Declare the Load Balancer in `src/server.ts`, targeting the Server
over its **private** IP:

```diff lang="typescript"
// src/server.ts
+export const Edge = Hetzner.LoadBalancer("edge", {
+  location: "nbg1",
+  loadBalancerType: "lb11",
+  networks: [Net],
+  targets: [{ type: "server", server: Box, usePrivateIp: true }],
+  services: [
+    {
+      protocol: "http",
+      listenPort: 80,
+      destinationPort: 3000,
+      healthCheck: {
+        protocol: "http",
+        port: 3000,
+        interval: 3,
+        timeout: 2,
+        retries: 2,
+        http: { path: "/health" },
+      },
+    },
+  ],
+});
```

The LB listens on port 80 and forwards to port 3000 on the Server,
reaching it through the private Network (`usePrivateIp: true`). Its
health check polls the same `/health` route the deploy already
uses — an unhealthy Service is pulled out of rotation automatically.

## Lock down the Server

With traffic flowing through the private network, close the public
app port. Apply a Firewall to the Server that allows SSH from
anywhere but port 3000 only from inside the Network:

```diff lang="typescript"
// src/server.ts
+export const Wall = Hetzner.Firewall("wall", {
+  applyTo: [Box],
+  rules: [
+    {
+      direction: "in",
+      protocol: "tcp",
+      port: "22",
+      sourceIps: ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"],
+      description: "ssh",
+    },
+    {
+      direction: "in",
+      protocol: "tcp",
+      port: "3000",
+      sourceIps: ["10.0.0.0/16"],
+      description: "api via private net",
+    },
+  ],
+});
```

A Hetzner Firewall is default-deny for inbound traffic: once
applied, only what a rule allows gets through. Outbound stays open.

## Surface the Load Balancer URL

Yield the new resources from the Stack and output the LB address
instead of the Server's:

```diff lang="typescript"
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Hetzner from "alchemy/Hetzner";
+import * as Output from "alchemy/Output";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import Api from "./src/api.ts";
-import { Box } from "./src/server.ts";
+import { Box, Edge, Wall } from "./src/server.ts";

// ...
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const server = yield* Box;
+    const lb = yield* Edge;
+    yield* Wall;
    const api = yield* Api;

    return {
      ipv4: server.ipv4,
-      url: api.url,
+      url: Output.interpolate`http://${lb.ipv4}`,
    };
  }),
```

`Output.interpolate` builds a string from resource outputs — the
LB's IP isn't known until it's created, so the template resolves
after deploy.

## Deploy

```sh
bun alchemy deploy
```

```text
Plan: 3 to create, 1 to update

+ net (Hetzner.Network)
+ edge (Hetzner.LoadBalancer)
+ wall (Hetzner.Firewall)
~ box (Hetzner.Server)

Proceed?
◉ Yes ○ No
✓ net (Hetzner.Network) created
✓ box (Hetzner.Server) updated
✓ edge (Hetzner.LoadBalancer) created
✓ wall (Hetzner.Firewall) created
{
  ipv4: "203.0.113.10",
  url: "http://198.51.100.7",
}
```

## Try it out

The app now answers on the Load Balancer:

```sh
curl http://198.51.100.7/hello.txt
# → Hello, Volume!
```

And the direct route is gone — the Firewall drops it:

```sh
curl --max-time 5 http://203.0.113.10:3000/hello.txt
# → curl: (28) Connection timed out
```

:::tip[Your own domain?]
Hetzner DNS is part of the provider too: declare a `Hetzner.Zone`
and a `Hetzner.RecordSet` pointing at `lb.ipv4`, and add a managed
`Hetzner.Certificate` to terminate TLS on the Load Balancer. See
[DNS](/hetzner/networking/dns) and
[Networking](/hetzner/networking#load-balancer).
:::

## Clean up

You're done — tear everything down so the hourly billing stops:

```sh
bun alchemy destroy
```

Alchemy deletes everything in reverse dependency order — Service,
Load Balancer, Firewall, Volume, Server, Network, SSH key.

## Recap

Over four parts you built a complete, production-shaped deployment:

- A Server provisioned in seconds, with an Alchemy-managed deploy
  key
- An HTTP Service bundled, shipped over SSH, and supervised by
  systemd — updated only when its code hash changes
- A Volume mounted at `/data` whose contents outlive deploys
- A private Network, a health-checked Load Balancer, and a
  default-deny Firewall

## Where next

- [Services](/hetzner/compute/services) — background workers,
  environment variables, multiple Services per Server.
- [Servers](/hetzner/compute/servers) — SSH access, snapshots,
  placement groups, cloud-init.
- [DNS](/hetzner/networking/dns) — zones and records for your own
  domain.
- [Testing](/testing) — deploy this stack from an integration test
  and drive it over HTTP.
- [CI](/environments/ci) — run `alchemy deploy` from GitHub Actions
  with `HCLOUD_TOKEN`.

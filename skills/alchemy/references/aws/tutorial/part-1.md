# Part 1: Your First Stack

> Install Alchemy, create a Stack with an AWS S3 Bucket, and deploy it.

In this first part you'll install Alchemy and Effect, create a Stack
with an AWS S3 Bucket, and deploy it — all in under five minutes.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (recommended) or Node.js 22+
- An AWS account and an IAM identity with permission to create the
  resources you plan to deploy

## Create a project

Start with an empty directory and initialize a `package.json`:

```sh
mkdir my-app && cd my-app && bun init -y
```

## Install dependencies

Install <code>alchemy@latest</code> and <code>effect@{effectVersion}</code>:

```sh
bun add "alchemy@latest" "effect@rc" "@effect/platform-bun@rc" "@effect/platform-node@rc"
```

:::tip
We recommend Bun for the best development experience, but Node.js
works too.
:::

## Create the Stack

Every Alchemy program starts with a `Stack` — a collection of
Resources managed by Providers with state tracked between deploys.

Create an `alchemy.run.ts` file:

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as AWS from "alchemy/AWS";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  {
    providers: AWS.providers(),
    state: AWS.state(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // we'll add resources here next
  }),
);
```

`Alchemy.Stack` is the root of every app. The first argument
(`"MyApp"`) doubles as a logical id and as the prefix Alchemy uses
when AWS asks for physical resource names.

## How credentials resolve

`providers: AWS.providers()` registers every AWS resource and IAM
policy binding that ships with Alchemy, and resolves credentials from
your Alchemy [profile](/environments/profiles) — SSO, environment
variables, or stored access keys. You'll pick one interactively the
first time you deploy; see [Setup](/aws/setup) for the details of
each method.

## Where state lives

`state: AWS.state()` stores deploy state in an account-regional S3
bucket (`alchemy-state-{accountId}-{region}-an`), created lazily on
the first deploy. Because the state lives in your AWS account rather
than on disk, the same configuration works locally and in CI with no
extra setup.

:::note[Other state stores]
For purely local iteration you can use `Alchemy.localState()`
instead, which writes state under `.alchemy/` next to your code — or
[write your own](/state-store).
:::

## Add a Resource

Resources represent cloud infrastructure — buckets, tables, queues,
functions, and so on. Each resource is `yield*`-ed inside the Stack's
Effect generator.

Add an S3 Bucket:

```diff lang="typescript"
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as AWS from "alchemy/AWS";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  {
    providers: AWS.providers(),
    state: AWS.state(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
+    const bucket = yield* AWS.S3.Bucket("Bucket");
  }),
);
```

`yield* AWS.S3.Bucket("Bucket")` registers the resource with the
Stack under the logical id `Bucket` and returns a typed `Bucket`
handle. We didn't pass a `bucketName`, so Alchemy generates a unique
physical name from the app, stage, and logical id.

## Return Stack outputs

Stack outputs let you see important values after a deploy. Return an
object from the generator to expose them:

```diff lang="typescript"
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* AWS.S3.Bucket("Bucket");
+
+   return {
+     bucketName: bucket.bucketName,
+   };
  }),
```

`bucket.bucketName` is an Output — a typed reference to an attribute
the cloud will produce. It resolves during deploy and prints with the
rest of the stack outputs.

## Deploy

Run `alchemy deploy` to create the Bucket on AWS:

```sh
bun alchemy deploy
```

The first time you deploy, Alchemy prompts you to pick an AWS
authentication method — **SSO** (recommended), **environment
variables**, or **stored access keys** — and saves the choice to your
**`default`** [profile](/environments/profiles). The region and account
come from whichever method you pick. See [Setup](/aws/setup) for a
walkthrough of all three.

:::tip
To re-run the credential prompt later (e.g. to switch from stored
keys to SSO, or to add a `prod` profile) use
`alchemy login --configure` or
`alchemy login --profile prod --configure`.
:::

```text
Plan: 1 to create
+ Bucket (AWS.S3.Bucket)

Proceed?
◉ Yes ○ No
✓ Bucket (AWS.S3.Bucket) created
{
  bucketName: "myapp-bucket-a1b2c3d4e5",
}
```

Alchemy shows a plan, asks for confirmation, creates the resource,
and prints the stack outputs. Your bucket is live on AWS.

:::tip
By convention, Alchemy looks for `alchemy.run.ts` at the root of your
project. You can specify a different file with
`alchemy deploy <file>`.
:::

## Verify it worked

Your newly created bucket will be listed in the S3 section of the AWS
Console (or via `aws s3 ls` if you have the AWS CLI installed).

Run `alchemy deploy` again. Because nothing changed, the bucket shows
as a no-op:

```text
Plan: no changes

{
  bucketName: "myapp-bucket-a1b2c3d4e5",
}
```

This is the core loop — declare resources in code, deploy, and
Alchemy figures out what changed.

## Destroy (optional)

The inverse of `deploy` is `destroy` — it plans against an empty
desired state and deletes everything the stack created:

```sh
bun alchemy destroy
```

Try it if you like, then run `bun alchemy deploy` again to bring the
bucket back — we'll build on it in Part 2.

## Recap

You now have:

- An `alchemy.run.ts` with a Stack and an AWS S3 Bucket
- A live bucket deployed to your AWS account
- Stack outputs showing the bucket name

In [Part 2](/aws/tutorial/part-2), you'll add a Lambda Function with
a public URL that reads and writes objects in this bucket.

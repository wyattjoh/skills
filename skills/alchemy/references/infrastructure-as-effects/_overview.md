# Infrastructure as Effects

> One Effect program models both your runtime code and the infrastructure it runs on — Runtimes carry code, Bindings wire resources into them, Phases split deploy from runtime, Layers package it all behind typed services.

Infrastructure as Effects is Alchemy's model for building
applications. The code that runs inside a Worker or Lambda Function
and the infrastructure it runs on are one Effect program. A
**Runtime**, such as a Worker, is a
[Resource](/infrastructure-as-code/resource) that carries its own
code, and the resources it uses are wired in as typed values:

```typescript
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as HttpServerResponse from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerResponse";

export const Uploads = Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Uploads");

export default Cloudflare.Worker(
  "Api",
  { main: import.meta.url },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(Uploads);

    return {
      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
        const obj = yield* bucket.get("hello.txt");
        return obj
          ? HttpServerResponse.text(yield* obj.text())
          : HttpServerResponse.text("Not found", { status: 404 });
      }),
    };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucketBinding)),
);
```

Traditional IaC splits this in two. One file declares the bucket and
the Worker. Another file is the code the Worker runs, reaching for the
bucket through its environment. Alchemy supports that shape too:

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";

export const Uploads = Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Uploads");

export const Api = Cloudflare.Worker("Api", {
  main: "./src/api.ts",
  env: { Uploads },
});

export type ApiEnv = Cloudflare.InferEnv<typeof Api>;
```

```typescript
// src/api.ts
import type { ApiEnv } from "../alchemy.run.ts";

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: ApiEnv) {
    const obj = await env.Uploads.get("hello.txt");
    return obj
      ? new Response(await obj.text())
      : new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
  },
};
```

Two files, held together by the name `Uploads`. The Effect form above
is those two files as one. `bucket` is a value the handler closes over,
and the code that uses the bucket sits next to the line that declares
it.

Everything in this section is in that one Worker. Here is the map.

## Runtimes carry their code

`Cloudflare.Worker` is a **Runtime**. Its props are the cloud
configuration, and `main: import.meta.url` tells Alchemy to bundle
this file's default export as the Worker's code. The Effect is that
code, and it always has the same shape:

```typescript
Effect.gen(function* () {
  // bind what you need
  const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(Uploads);

  // return what you expose
  return { fetch: /* ... */ };
});
```

[Runtime](/infrastructure-as-effects/runtime) covers that shape, the
`fetch` and RPC interface it returns, and the three ways to declare
one.

## Bindings wire resources in

`yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(Uploads)` is a **Binding**. It
hands back a typed client and generates whatever the client needs to
work: a native binding on Cloudflare, an IAM statement and an
environment variable on AWS:

```typescript
const getItem = yield* AWS.DynamoDB.GetItem(Jobs);
// → { Action: ["dynamodb:GetItem"], Resource: [Jobs.tableArn] }
// → Jobs_tableName=Jobs-a1b2c3
```

There is no `env.Uploads` to reach for. The binding is the SDK. See
[Bindings](/infrastructure-as-effects/binding) for how they work.

An [Event Source](/infrastructure-as-effects/event-sources) is a
Binding that runs an Effect or `Stream` in the background, whenever
something happens on the resource. A
[Sink](/infrastructure-as-effects/sinks) is the converse, a Binding
you sink a `Stream` into:

```typescript
const outbound = yield* AWS.SQS.QueueSink(Outbound);

yield* AWS.SQS.consumeQueueMessages(Inbound, (records) =>
  records.pipe(
    Stream.map((record) => record.body.toUpperCase()),
    Stream.run(outbound),
  ),
);
```

## Layers package it all

A Binding is a contract plus a Layer that implements it, which is why
`ReadWriteBucketBinding` can be swapped for `ReadWriteBucketHttp`
without touching the handler. The same split works for services of
your own. Declare a `Context.Service`, implement it with a Layer that
carries its own resources and bindings, and the handler depends on the
service alone:

```typescript
Effect.gen(function* () {
  const jobs = yield* JobService;

  return {
    fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
      return HttpServerResponse.json(yield* jobs.getJob("job-1"));
    }),
  };
}).pipe(Effect.provide(JobServiceKV))
```

Provide `JobServiceKV` and a KV namespace is created and bound. Provide
`JobServiceDynamo` and a DynamoDB table is instead. The handler doesn't
change. [Layers](/infrastructure-as-effects/layers) builds one from
scratch, and [Circular Bindings](/infrastructure-as-effects/circular-bindings)
uses the split to let two Workers call each other.

## Two phases, one program

The Worker's Effect runs in two phases. The outer Effect is the
**Construction phase**. It runs at deploy time, where the binding
records what it needs, and again at cold start, where the same line
builds the live client. The inner `fetch` Effect is the **Runtime
phase**. It runs per request, only inside the deployed Worker:

```typescript
Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Construction: deploy time and cold start
  const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(Uploads);

  return {
    // Runtime: per request, inside the deployed Worker
    fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
      const obj = yield* bucket.get("hello.txt");
    }),
  };
});
```

Both phases are one program, so `bucket` is a value the handler closes
over rather than something looked up at request time.
[Phases](/infrastructure-as-effects/phases) explains exactly what runs
when.

## Built into every Runtime

[Telemetry](/infrastructure-as-effects/telemetry) is a Layer too.
Provide an exporter alongside your bindings and every request, queue
batch, and cron fire exports the traces and logs Effect already emits.
[Custom Runtime](/infrastructure-as-effects/custom-runtime) brings the
whole model to a compute target Alchemy doesn't ship.

## Where next

1. [Runtime](/infrastructure-as-effects/runtime) — Resources that carry the code they run.
2. [Bindings](/infrastructure-as-effects/binding) — what one `yield*` generates.
3. [Layers](/infrastructure-as-effects/layers) — encapsulating infrastructure behind services.
4. [Event Sources](/infrastructure-as-effects/event-sources) — resources that trigger your Function, as Effect `Stream`s.
5. [Sinks](/infrastructure-as-effects/sinks) — resources you write to, as Effect `Sink`s.
6. [Phases](/infrastructure-as-effects/phases) — plantime vs runtime in depth.
7. [Circular Bindings](/infrastructure-as-effects/circular-bindings) — two services that reference each other.
8. [Telemetry](/infrastructure-as-effects/telemetry) — exporters as Layers.
9. [Custom Runtime](/infrastructure-as-effects/custom-runtime) — bring the model to a new compute target.

# Auth

> The engine holds no users, no credentials, and no policy. The middleware of the API that mounts the routes decides who may call them, and Git.Hooks decides which refs may move.

Authentication and authorization happen outside the engine, in the
`HttpApi` middleware you own. The engine's routes declare no
middleware and no auth errors; `Git.Api.middleware(Yours)` puts one in
front of every git route, and the engine never sees a credential. The
one decision a middleware cannot make, which refs a push may move, is
git's pre-receive hook, and `Git.Hooks` is that hook as a service.

| | Decides | Runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| your middleware | who may call which route | in front of the route, once per request |
| `Git.Hooks` | which refs may move, and for whom | after the pack is parsed, before any ref moves |

## The middleware

An `HttpApiMiddleware.Service`, declared and implemented by you, put
on the API you derive from `Git.Api`:

```typescript
export class Authenticated extends HttpApiMiddleware.Service<
  Authenticated,
  { provides: Session; requires: Alchemy.RuntimeContext }
>()("app/Authenticated", { error: Unauthorized }) {}

export class AppApi extends Git.Api.middleware(Authenticated) {}
```

`provides` is what the middleware puts in context for the routes
behind it, your own service. `requires: Alchemy.RuntimeContext` lets
the middleware use the Worker's bindings and resources. `error` is
what it may answer with, so the typed client sees a `401` as
`Unauthorized`.

The implementation is a Layer. It runs once, when the Worker starts,
and that is where resources and services are yielded; what it returns
runs once per request:

```typescript
export const AuthenticatedLive = Layer.effect(
  Authenticated,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const auth = yield* Auth; // Better Auth, or whatever knows your users
    return (httpEffect, { endpoint }) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        const user = yield* resolve; // a user, or undefined
        if (user !== undefined) {
          return yield* Effect.provideService(httpEffect, Session, { user });
        }
        return unauthorized;
      });
  }),
);
```

Every question about who may do what to a repository is answered
here: the tutorial's middleware lets a signed-in user act under their
own owner name (`HttpRouter.params` has `owner` on every repository
route), a team member too, and refuses the rest. A `git` client sends
HTTP Basic with the credential in the password field;
`HttpApiBuilder.securityDecode(HttpApiSecurity.basic)` reads it. A refusal that carries `WWW-Authenticate` makes `git` ask for a
password:

```typescript
const unauthorized = HttpServerResponse.jsonUnsafe(
  { _tag: "Unauthorized" },
  { status: 401, headers: { "www-authenticate": 'Basic realm="git"' } },
);
```

[Getting Started](/git/getting-started) is the whole thing with one
shared secret; [Part 3](/git/tutorial/part-3) builds it with Better
Auth sessions and API keys.

## Public repositories

`public` is a flag the engine stores on a repository and reports. What
it grants is the middleware's decision. `Git.isRead` says whether a
request to one of the engine's routes only reads: the REST and raw
reads, the GitHub facade's `GET`s, the ref advertisement for a fetch,
and `git-upload-pack`. The Registry says whether the repository is
public:

```typescript
const registry = yield* Git.RegistryStore; // in the Layer

// per request
const request = yield* HttpServerRequest;
const { owner = "", repo = "" } = yield* HttpRouter.params;
const entry = yield* registry
  .resolve(owner.toLowerCase(), repo.toLowerCase().replace(/\.git$/, ""))
  .pipe(Effect.catchTag("StoreError", () => Effect.succeed(undefined)));
if (Git.isRead(endpoint, request) && (entry === undefined || entry.public)) {
  return yield* Effect.provideService(httpEffect, Session, { user: null });
}
```

Letting an anonymous read of a repository that does not exist reach
the route means its `404` confirms nothing about private ones, which
answer `401`.

## Your routes

A route of your own declares the middleware it relies on, and its
handler reads what the middleware provided:

```typescript
export class Me extends Http.get<Me>()("me", "/api/v1/me", {
  success: User,
  error: Unauthorized,
  middleware: [Authenticated],
}) {}

export const MeLive = Me.make(
  Effect.succeed(() =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const { user } = yield* Session;
      if (user === null) return yield* new Unauthorized();
      return user;
    }),
  ),
);
```

The engine's route classes do not declare your middleware. A handler
that replaces one of them, or a hook, reads your service as an option:

```typescript
const session = yield* Effect.serviceOption(Session);
const user = Option.isSome(session) ? session.value.user : null;
```

## Hooks

```typescript
interface HooksShape {
  preReceive(input: {
    repo: RepoMetaData;
    updates: ReadonlyArray<{ ref: string; oldOid: string; newOid: string }>;
  }): Effect<ReadonlyArray<{ ref: string; reason: string }>>;
}
```

`preReceive` runs on `git push`, on the REST ref writes, and on a pull
request merge, with the parsed updates: `oldOid` is all zeros for a
create, `newOid` all zeros for a delete. It returns the refs to refuse
with a reason; an empty array accepts. A push with any refused ref is
rejected as a whole, and git reports the reason per ref. REST and a
merge answer a typed `403`, `HookRejected`. It runs in the Worker,
inside the request, so whatever your middleware provided is in
context:

```typescript
export const ProtectedMain = Layer.succeed(Git.Hooks, {
  preReceive: ({ repo, updates }) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const session = yield* Effect.serviceOption(Session);
      const user = Option.isSome(session) ? session.value.user : null;
      return updates.flatMap((update) =>
        update.ref === "refs/heads/main" && user?.id !== repo.owner
          ? [{ ref: update.ref, reason: "only the owner moves main" }]
          : [],
      );
    }),
});
```

`Git.Hooks` is optional; without it every update is accepted, and
`Git.HooksNone` says so explicitly. A hook may be a `Layer.effect` that
reads your own data. Who may write to a repository at all is the
middleware's question, as the team rule in [Part 4](/git/tutorial/part-4)
shows. A hook that must see the commit a merge writes, or react after a
push, decorates `Git.RepoStore` instead; [Repository](/git/blocks/repositories)
shows it.

## What the engine keeps

The push pipeline's internal hash route is not part of `Git.Api`. It
is `Git.InternalApi`, which `Git.Server` mounts beside your API and
outside your middleware, and it authenticates with a deploy-time
random secret no user holds. There is no tokens table, no admin key,
and no principal. Credentials are your authentication's, and only your
authentication ever sees them.

# Server

> Every plane as one HttpApi of route classes. Groups you can pick, Handlers you can replace one at a time, Server.layer to serve it behind your middleware, and ServerLive as the open default.

`Git.Server` is the composed HTTP surface behind one `fetch`.
`Git.Server.layer(api)` serves an API derived from `Git.Api`, yours,
with your middleware in front of every route; `ServerLive` is the open
default, `Git.Api` with nothing in front:

```typescript
export default Cloudflare.Worker(
  "Git",
  { main: import.meta.url, ...Git.GIT_WORKER_OPTIONS },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const git = yield* Git.Server;
    return { fetch: git.fetch };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(GitLive)),
);
```

It is not a Worker. You write the Worker, so you choose its name, its
domain, its compatibility date, and what else runs beside it. And
`Server.layer` is not the only way in: everything it composes is an
ordinary Effect `HttpApi`, exported piece by piece.

## Three planes, one API

| Group | Path | Client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Git.Protocol` | `/:owner/:repo.git/info/refs`, `git-upload-pack`, `git-receive-pack` | `git` |
| `Git.Repos`, `Git.Refs`, `Git.Objects`, `Git.Pulls` | `/api/v1/**` | your code, `curl`, the typed client |
| `Git.GitHub` | `/api/v3/**` | `gh api`, Octokit |

`Git.Api` is all six groups. Derive yours from it, with your
middleware in front and your routes beside, or build one from a
subset:

```typescript
export class AppApi extends Git.Api.add(AppRoutes).middleware(Authenticated) {}

// or: no pull requests, no GitHub facade
export class SmallApi extends HttpApi.make("git")
  .add(Git.Repos).add(Git.Refs).add(Git.Objects).add(Git.Protocol)
  .middleware(Authenticated) {}
```

No git route carries middleware of its own, and none decides who may
call it: that is the middleware of the API that mounts it, and
[Auth](/git/blocks/auth) is the pattern.

## Routes

Every endpoint is an `alchemy/Http` route class: an `HttpApiEndpoint`
that also names the tag of its implementation. It goes in a group like
any endpoint, and the client, OpenAPI, and middleware come from Effect
unchanged.

```typescript
export class GetRepo extends Http.get<GetRepo>()("get", "/repos/:owner/:repo", {
  params: RepoPath,
  success: Repo,
  error: [RepoNotFound],
}) {}
```

A route of your own may declare `middleware`, the middleware it relies
on, so its handler can read what that middleware provides.

`Route.make(init)` is an implementation as a Layer. `init` runs once
when the layer is built and returns the per-request handler:

```typescript
export const GetRepoLive = GetRepo.make(
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const repos = yield* Git.RepoStore;              // build time
    return Effect.fn(function* ({ params }) {       // request time
      return yield* repos.get(params.owner, params.repo);
    });
  }),
);
```

The handler receives the decoded request, `params`, `query`,
`payload`, `headers`, and the raw `request`, and returns the declared
success or a raw `HttpServerResponse`. The wire routes stream: they
declare no payload, read `request.stream`, and answer with the
response they build.

## Handlers

`Git.Handlers` is the default implementation of every route, one
`*Live` Layer each, `Git.GetRepoLive` through `Git.ReceivePackLive`.
`Git.Server.layer(api)` requires an implementation of every route the
API has, and the middleware it declares. Replace any one by providing
another Layer for the same route nearer than `Git.Handlers`:

```typescript
Git.Server.layer(AppApi).pipe(
  Layer.provide([MeLive, GitHubUserLive]),       // yours, and one override
  Layer.provide(Git.Handlers),                   // the engine's for the rest
  Layer.provide(AuthenticatedLive),              // the middleware
)
```

Leave a route unimplemented and the compiler names it, not the group.
Every route shares one core per Worker: the registry cache, the
Durable Object stubs, and the push admission gate are built once
however many routes you mount.

Under `Server.layer` is `Http.handlers(api)`, which builds the ordinary
`HttpApiBuilder.group` for every group of the API whose endpoints are
all routes, under that API's middleware. To own the router, build it
by hand:

```typescript
HttpApiBuilder.layer(AppApi).pipe(
  Layer.provide(Http.handlers(AppApi)),          // mounts every route group
  Layer.provide([MeLive, GitHubUserLive]),
  Layer.provide(Git.Handlers),
  Layer.provide(AuthenticatedLive),
  Layer.provide(Http.Platform),                  // no filesystem on Workers
  HttpRouter.toHttpEffect,
)
```

A group with a plain endpoint is yours to implement with
`HttpApiBuilder.group` as usual. A host built by hand that uses a
fan-out [Hasher](/git/blocks/hasher) mounts `Git.InternalApi` too, the
engine's own hash route, which `Server.layer` mounts for you outside
your middleware.

**`Git.ServerLive`** is `Server.layer(Git.Api)` with `Git.Handlers`:
every route, nothing in front. Provide it and `git.fetch` is an open
host.

## Worker options

```typescript
{ main: import.meta.url, ...Git.GIT_WORKER_OPTIONS }
```

`nodejs_compat` for zlib and crypto, a 300 s CPU ceiling so a large
push can be verified, and a service binding to the Worker itself for
the hasher. Spread it first and put your own options after it.

## Under your own routes

`git.fetch` is an Effect that reads the request from context and
returns a response, so it composes with anything else you serve:

```typescript
Effect.gen(function* () {
  const git = yield* Git.Server;

  return {
    fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
      const request = yield* HttpServerRequest.HttpServerRequest;
      if (request.url === "/healthz") {
        return HttpServerResponse.text("ok");
      }
      return yield* git.fetch;
    }),
  };
});
```

To put a whole application on the same domain, keep the git host as
its own Worker and forward the git paths to it over a service binding.
[Part 3 of the tutorial](/git/tutorial/part-3) shows the front door.

## The typed client

The API is a value, so the same schema types the server, the client,
and your tests:

```typescript
import { GitApi } from "alchemy/Git";
import * as HttpApiClient from "effect/unstable/httpapi/HttpApiClient";

const client = yield* HttpApiClient.make(GitApi, { baseUrl: host });

const repo = yield* client.repos.get({
  params: { owner: "acme", repo: "web" },
});
```

[Repositories](/git/repositories) and [Pull requests](/git/pull-requests)
use it throughout.

# Part 2: Repositories

> Create a repository on your host, push to it, then let anyone read a public one. The REST plane and the shared secret, used before anything else depends on them.

You have a deployed host and its URL, called `$HOST` below, and the
secret you exported when you deployed. By the end of this part you have
pushed, cloned, taught the middleware what a public repository means,
and seen what one secret cannot express.

## Create a repository

Repositories are named `owner/name`. The owner is a name you choose;
with one shared secret there are no users behind it. `curl -u` sends
the secret the way `git` will, as the password of HTTP Basic:

```sh
curl -u "x:$GIT_SECRET" -X POST "$HOST/api/v1/repos" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"owner":"acme","name":"web"}'
```

The response carries the repository and its clone URL.

## Push

The secret goes in the password field of the remote. The username is
ignored:

```sh
git remote add origin "https://x:$GIT_SECRET@$HOST/acme/web.git"
git push -u origin main
```

Every object in the push was hashed and checked against the repository
before `main` moved. Push again with one more commit and it takes a
fraction of a second.

## Make it public

`public` is a flag the engine stores and reports. What it grants is
your middleware's decision, and so far the middleware refuses every
request without the secret. Set the flag first:

```sh
curl -u "x:$GIT_SECRET" -X PATCH "$HOST/api/v1/repos/acme/web" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"public":true}'
```

## Let anyone read it

The middleware asks the Registry, the block that resolves `owner/name`,
whether the repository is public, and `Git.isRead` whether the request
only reads: the REST and raw reads, the ref advertisement for a fetch,
and `git-upload-pack`, which is what a clone is:

```diff lang="typescript"
// src/git.ts
+import * as HttpRouter from "effect/unstable/http/HttpRouter";
+import * as HttpServerRequest from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerRequest";

export const AuthenticatedLive = Layer.effect(
  Authenticated,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const secret = yield* (yield* GitSecret).text;
+    const registry = yield* Git.RegistryStore;
-    return (httpEffect) =>
+    return (httpEffect, { endpoint }) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        const { password } = yield* HttpApiBuilder.securityDecode(
          HttpApiSecurity.basic,
        );
        if (Redacted.value(password) === Redacted.value(yield* secret)) {
          return yield* httpEffect;
        }
+        const request = yield* HttpServerRequest.HttpServerRequest;
+        const { owner = "", repo = "" } = yield* HttpRouter.params;
+        const entry = yield* registry
+          .resolve(owner.toLowerCase(), repo.toLowerCase().replace(/\.git$/, ""))
+          .pipe(Effect.catchTag("StoreError", () => Effect.succeed(undefined)));
+        if (Git.isRead(endpoint, request) && entry?.public) {
+          return yield* httpEffect;
+        }
        return HttpServerResponse.empty({
          status: 401,
          headers: { "www-authenticate": 'Basic realm="git"' },
        });
      });
  }),
);
```

The middleware needs `Git.RegistryStore`, and `Git.RegistryDurableObject`
is already in the graph, so nothing else changes. Deploy, and anyone
can clone with no credentials:

```sh
git clone "https://$HOST/acme/web.git" verify
git -C verify fsck --strict
```

Writes still need the secret. A private repository answers an
anonymous request with `401` and `WWW-Authenticate`, so git prompts.

## The same from code

The REST plane is an Effect `HttpApi`, so the operations above are
typed calls from any Effect program:

```typescript
import { GitApi } from "alchemy/Git";
import * as HttpApiClient from "effect/unstable/httpapi/HttpApiClient";
import * as HttpClient from "effect/unstable/http/HttpClient";
import * as HttpClientRequest from "effect/unstable/http/HttpClientRequest";

const client = yield* HttpApiClient.make(GitApi, {
  baseUrl: host,
  transformClient: HttpClient.mapRequest(
    HttpClientRequest.basicAuth("x", secret),
  ),
});

const created = yield* client.repos.create({
  payload: { owner: "acme", name: "api", public: false },
});
```

A duplicate name is a typed `RepoAlreadyExists`, not a string to
parse.

## Where the secret stops

One secret is one key to everything. It cannot say who Dana is, it
cannot give a teammate a credential of their own, and it cannot make a
repository belong to anyone. Those are questions for your
authentication. [Part 3](/git/tutorial/part-3) puts it in front of
the host. [Repositories](/git/repositories) is the reference
for everything the REST plane does with a repository.

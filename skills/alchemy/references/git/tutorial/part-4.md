# Part 4: Your own rules

> git's pre-receive hook as a service. Protect main, let a team share a repository, and answer from your own data. It never sees a credential.

You have users signing in and pushing to their own repositories. Now
the rules: a teammate should be able to push to a repository they do
not own, and pushes to `main` should only come from its owner. By the
end of this part the first rule is two lines in the middleware, and
the second is a hook.

## A team

Who may write to a repository is the middleware's decision, and your
data decides who is on a team. Read it there:

```diff lang="typescript"
// src/git.ts
export const AuthenticatedLive = Layer.effect(
  Authenticated,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const auth = yield* Auth;
    const registry = yield* Git.RegistryStore;
+    const teams = yield* Teams; // yours: who may write to which owner

    // …

    return (httpEffect, { endpoint }) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        const user = yield* resolve;
        const { owner } = yield* HttpRouter.params;
        const own =
          owner === undefined || owner.toLowerCase() === user?.id.toLowerCase();
-        if (user !== undefined && own) {
+        const member =
+          user !== undefined && owner !== undefined
+            ? yield* teams.isMember(user.id, owner.toLowerCase())
+            : false;
+        if (user !== undefined && (own || member)) {
          return yield* Effect.provideService(httpEffect, Session, { user });
        }
        // …
      });
  }),
);
```

A teammate now pushes anywhere in the repository, `main` included.

## What the middleware cannot decide

The middleware sees a request. On a push, the request is a pack whose
ref commands have not been parsed yet, so "may this user move `main`?"
cannot be answered there. git's answer is the pre-receive hook, which
runs after the pack is parsed and before any ref moves, and `Git.Hooks`
is that hook as a service:

```typescript
interface HooksShape {
  preReceive(input: {
    repo: RepoMetaData;
    updates: ReadonlyArray<{ ref: string; oldOid: string; newOid: string }>;
  }): Effect<ReadonlyArray<{ ref: string; reason: string }>>;
}
```

It returns the refs to refuse, each with a reason, and an empty array
accepts. It runs in the Worker, inside the request, so whatever your
middleware put in context is readable there. It runs on `git push`, on
the REST ref writes, and on a pull request merge.

## Protect main

The `Session` from Part 3 says who is pushing, and the middleware
already let them in. The engine's route classes do not declare your
middleware, so the hook reads it as an option:

```typescript
// src/hooks.ts
import * as Git from "alchemy/Git";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";
import * as Option from "effect/Option";
import { Session } from "./git.ts";

export const ProtectedMain: Layer.Layer<Git.Hooks> = Layer.succeed(Git.Hooks, {
  preReceive: ({ repo, updates }) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const session = yield* Effect.serviceOption(Session);
      const user = Option.isSome(session) ? session.value.user : null;
      return updates.flatMap((update) =>
        update.ref === "refs/heads/main" && user?.id !== repo.owner
          ? [{ ref: update.ref, reason: "only the owner moves main" }]
          : [],
      );
    }),
});
```

`repo.owner` is the owner name, lowercased, and so is the user's id
when the repository was created under it in Part 3. A teammate moves
every other ref; only the owner moves `main`.

```diff lang="typescript"
// src/git.ts
+import { ProtectedMain } from "./hooks.ts";

const GitLive = Git.Server.layer(AppApi).pipe(
  Layer.provide([MeLive, GitHubUserLive]),
  Layer.provide(Git.Handlers),
  Layer.provide(AuthenticatedLive),
+  Layer.provide(ProtectedMain),
  Layer.provide(Git.ReposDurableObject),
```

`Git.Hooks` is optional. Without it, every ref update is accepted.

```sh
bun alchemy deploy
```

## Try it

Push a branch with a teammate's key, then push `main`:

```sh
git push origin HEAD:feature
git push origin main
```

The branch lands. The push to `main` is refused in-band with the ref
named and the reason you wrote, the way git reports any rejected ref.
The owner's key moves it. The same rule answers the REST ref writes
and a merge with a typed `403`, `HookRejected`, naming the ref and the
reason. The host asked with the refs that move; it never asked what a
team is.

## Where you are

A git server you built in one file, inside your own API, with your
users and your rules, on your domain. From here:

- [Using your host](/git/clone-and-push) — what git clients, the REST
  plane, and the GitHub facade do day to day.
- [Building blocks](/git/blocks) — the reference for each line of the
  graph, [Auth](/git/blocks/auth) included.
- [Recipes](/git/recipes) — which lines change for which requirements,
  and how the host scales.

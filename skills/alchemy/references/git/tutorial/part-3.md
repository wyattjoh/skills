# Part 3: Your own API

> Git.Server is designed to be embedded. Build your own API around it with Better Auth, add a route of your own, replace one of the engine's, and serve your application from the same origin.

`Git.Server` is designed to be embedded in your application. It holds
few opinions about how the application is built, how users are
organized, or who has access to what. To authorize, build your own API
around the embedded server, then build your Git-enabled application on
that API.

This part does that with Better Auth. Users sign in from a browser,
mint their own API keys, and push with them, and the engine is
unchanged.

## What the server asks of your API

Nothing. The engine holds no users, no credentials, and no policy. The
middleware you put on the API decides who may call which route, and
`Git.Api.middleware(...)` puts one in front of every git route: the
REST plane, the git wire, the raw reads, and the GitHub facade. So far
that middleware is one shared secret. This part replaces it with one
that knows who is calling, and every route runs behind it.

## Better Auth

```sh
bun add @alchemy.run/better-auth better-auth @better-auth/api-key
```

Declare Better Auth once. It is yielded wherever it is needed, like
any other resource, and the engine de-dupes the declaration:

```typescript
// src/git.ts
import { BetterAuth } from "@alchemy.run/better-auth";
import { apiKey } from "@better-auth/api-key";

export const Auth = BetterAuth({
  basePath: "/api/auth",
  emailAndPassword: { enabled: true },
  plugins: [apiKey()],
});
```

## Who is calling

The middleware now provides an answer to the routes behind it: a
`Session`, holding the user, or `null` for an anonymous read. Routes
and hooks read it from context:

```typescript
import * as Context from "effect/Context";
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema";
import * as HttpApiMiddleware from "effect/unstable/httpapi/HttpApiMiddleware";

export const User = Schema.Struct({
  id: Schema.String,
  name: Schema.optional(Schema.String),
});

export class Session extends Context.Service<
  Session,
  { readonly user: typeof User.Type | null }
>()("app/Session") {}

export class Unauthorized extends Schema.TaggedError<Unauthorized>()(
  "Unauthorized",
  {},
  { httpApiStatus: 401 },
) {}

export class Authenticated extends HttpApiMiddleware.Service<
  Authenticated,
  { provides: Session; requires: Alchemy.RuntimeContext }
>()("app/Authenticated", { error: Unauthorized }) {}
```

`provides` is what the middleware puts in context for the route.
`error` is the failure it may answer with, so the typed client sees a
`401` as `Unauthorized`.

## The resolver

The Layer runs once, when the Worker starts, and that is where Better
Auth is yielded. What it returns runs once per request and answers
with a user, or `undefined`. The refusal carries `WWW-Authenticate`,
which is what makes `git` ask for a password:

```typescript
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";
import * as HttpServerResponse from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerResponse";

const unauthorized = HttpServerResponse.jsonUnsafe(
  { _tag: "Unauthorized" },
  { status: 401, headers: { "www-authenticate": 'Basic realm="git"' } },
);

export const AuthenticatedLive = Layer.effect(
  Authenticated,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const auth = yield* Auth;

    const resolve = Effect.gen(function* () {
      // TODO: resolve a user from the request
      return undefined;
    });

    return (httpEffect) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        const user = yield* resolve;
        if (user !== undefined) {
          return yield* Effect.provideService(httpEffect, Session, { user });
        }
        return unauthorized;
      });
  }),
);
```

Every request is refused so far. Better Auth fills in the two ways a
request names a user.

## API keys for git clients

A `git` client sends HTTP Basic with the key in the password field.
`HttpApiBuilder.securityDecode` reads it from the request, and
`verifyApiKey` says whose it is:

```diff lang="typescript"
+import * as Redacted from "effect/Redacted";
+import * as HttpApiBuilder from "effect/unstable/httpapi/HttpApiBuilder";
+import * as HttpApiSecurity from "effect/unstable/httpapi/HttpApiSecurity";

export const AuthenticatedLive = Layer.effect(
  Authenticated,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const auth = yield* Auth;

    const resolve = Effect.gen(function* () {
+      const { password } = yield* HttpApiBuilder.securityDecode(
+        HttpApiSecurity.basic,
+      );
+      const key = Redacted.value(password);
+      if (key !== "") {
+        const verified = yield* auth.api
+          .verifyApiKey({ body: { key } })
+          .pipe(
+            Effect.catchTag("BetterAuthApiError", () =>
+              Effect.succeed({ valid: false as const, key: null }),
+            ),
+          );
+        return verified.valid && verified.key
+          ? { id: verified.key.referenceId }
+          : undefined;
+      }
      return undefined;
    });
    // …
  }),
);
```

## Sessions for browsers

A request without a key carries the session cookie, or nothing.
`getSession` reads the same request:

```diff lang="typescript"
export const AuthenticatedLive = Layer.effect(
  Authenticated,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const auth = yield* Auth;

    const resolve = Effect.gen(function* () {
      const { password } = yield* HttpApiBuilder.securityDecode(
        HttpApiSecurity.basic,
      );
      const key = Redacted.value(password);
      if (key !== "") {
        // …
      }
-      return undefined;
+      const session = yield* auth
+        .getSession()
+        .pipe(Effect.catchTag("BetterAuthApiError", () => Effect.succeed(null)));
+      return session
+        ? { id: session.user.id, name: session.user.name }
+        : undefined;
    });
    // …
  }),
);
```

## Owners

A user now has a name, so a repository can belong to someone: the one
whose id is its owner name. A signed-in user may do anything under
their own name, and use the routes that have no owner at all, such as
creating a repository:

```diff lang="typescript"
+import * as HttpRouter from "effect/unstable/http/HttpRouter";

export const AuthenticatedLive = Layer.effect(
  Authenticated,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // …

    return (httpEffect) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        const user = yield* resolve;
-        if (user !== undefined) {
+        const { owner } = yield* HttpRouter.params;
+        const own =
+          owner === undefined || owner.toLowerCase() === user?.id.toLowerCase();
+        if (user !== undefined && own) {
          return yield* Effect.provideService(httpEffect, Session, { user });
        }
        return unauthorized;
      });
  }),
);
```

Owner names are lowercased by the engine, so the comparison is too.
Everything else is refused, a stranger's push included.

## Public repositories

Part 2 let anyone read a public repository, and that rule moves over
unchanged: the Registry says whether the repository is public,
`Git.isRead` whether the request only reads. An anonymous read of a
repository that does not exist reaches the route, whose `404` confirms
nothing about private ones. A signed-in stranger reads a public
repository the same way, as themselves:

```diff lang="typescript"
+import { HttpServerRequest } from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerRequest";

export const AuthenticatedLive = Layer.effect(
  Authenticated,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const auth = yield* Auth;
+    const registry = yield* Git.RegistryStore;

    const resolve = Effect.gen(function* () {
      // …
    });

+    const publicRead = Effect.gen(function* () {
+      const { owner = "", repo = "" } = yield* HttpRouter.params;
+      const entry = yield* registry
+        .resolve(owner.toLowerCase(), repo.toLowerCase().replace(/\.git$/, ""))
+        .pipe(Effect.catchTag("StoreError", () => Effect.succeed(undefined)));
+      return entry === undefined || entry.public;
+    });
+
-    return (httpEffect) =>
+    return (httpEffect, { endpoint }) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        const user = yield* resolve;
        const { owner } = yield* HttpRouter.params;
        const own =
          owner === undefined || owner.toLowerCase() === user?.id.toLowerCase();
        if (user !== undefined && own) {
          return yield* Effect.provideService(httpEffect, Session, { user });
        }
+        const request = yield* HttpServerRequest;
+        if (Git.isRead(endpoint, request) && (yield* publicRead)) {
+          return yield* Effect.provideService(httpEffect, Session, {
+            user: user ?? null,
+          });
+        }
        return unauthorized;
      });
  }),
);
```

One middleware now serves every git route: the REST plane, the wire,
the raw reads, and the GitHub facade.

## A route of your own

The git routes are `alchemy/Http` route classes: an `HttpApiEndpoint`
that also names the tag of its implementation. Yours are the same. `Me`
declares the middleware it relies on, so its handler can ask for the
`Session`:

```typescript
import * as Http from "alchemy/Http";

export class Me extends Http.get<Me>()("me", "/api/v1/me", {
  success: User,
  error: Unauthorized,
  middleware: [Authenticated],
}) {}

export const MeLive = Me.make(
  Effect.succeed(() =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const { user } = yield* Session;
      if (user === null) return yield* new Unauthorized();
      return user;
    }),
  ),
);
```

`Me.make` is the implementation as a Layer. Its `init` returns the
handler; `Effect.succeed` because this one has nothing to set up.

## Your API around the server

A route goes in a group, a group goes in an API. `Git.Api` is the git
groups, yours is one more, and the middleware goes in front of all of
them. This API is the boundary your application talks to:

```typescript
import * as HttpApiGroup from "effect/unstable/httpapi/HttpApiGroup";

export class AppRoutes extends HttpApiGroup.make("app").add(Me) {}

export class AppApi extends Git.Api.add(AppRoutes).middleware(Authenticated) {}
```

## The host

`Git.Server.layer(AppApi)` serves the API. It asks for an
implementation of every route, `Git.Handlers` for the engine's and
`MeLive` for yours, and for the middleware the API declares. Leave one
out and the compiler names it:

```diff lang="typescript"
-export class Api extends Git.Api.middleware(Authenticated) {}
-
-const GitLive = Git.Server.layer(Api).pipe(
+const GitLive = Git.Server.layer(AppApi).pipe(
+  Layer.provide(MeLive),
  Layer.provide(Git.Handlers),
  Layer.provide(AuthenticatedLive),
  Layer.provide(Git.ReposDurableObject),
  Layer.provide(Git.RegistryDurableObject),
  Layer.provide(Git.BlobStoreR2(GitObjects)),
  Layer.provide(Git.HasherInline),
);
```

Better Auth needs a database and its own routes under `/api/auth`.
Declare the database, and serve the auth routes in front of the git
host:

```diff lang="typescript"
+import { CloudflareD1 } from "@alchemy.run/better-auth/CloudflareD1";
+import { HttpServerRequest } from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerRequest";

export const GitObjects = Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("GitObjects");
+export const AuthDb = Cloudflare.D1.Database("AuthDb");

export default class GitHost extends Cloudflare.Worker<GitHost>()(
  "Git",
  { main: import.meta.url, ...Git.GIT_WORKER_OPTIONS },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
+    const auth = yield* Auth;
    const git = yield* Git.Server;
-    return { fetch: git.fetch };
+    return {
+      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
+        const request = yield* HttpServerRequest;
+        if (request.url.startsWith("/api/auth")) return yield* auth.fetch;
+        return yield* git.fetch;
+      }),
+    };
-  }).pipe(Effect.provide(GitLive)),
+  }).pipe(Effect.provide(GitLive), Effect.provide(CloudflareD1(AuthDb))),
) {}
```

The `GitSecret` and its `Random` are gone; delete them from the stack
too.

```sh
bun alchemy deploy
```

## Try it

Sign up, and Better Auth sets a session cookie:

```sh
curl -c jar -X POST "$HOST/api/auth/sign-up/email" \
  -H "Origin: $HOST" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Dana","email":"dana@example.com","password":"correct-horse-battery"}'
```

Create a repository under your own id. Owner names are lowercased:

```sh
ME=$(curl -s -b jar "$HOST/api/v1/me" | jq -r .id | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z')
curl -b jar -X POST "$HOST/api/v1/repos" \
  -H "Origin: $HOST" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"owner\":\"$ME\",\"name\":\"web\",\"public\":true}"
```

Mint an API key. It is shown once, and it is the password of your git
remote:

```sh
KEY=$(curl -s -b jar -X POST "$HOST/api/auth/api-key/create" \
  -H "Origin: $HOST" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"laptop"}' | jq -r .key)

git remote add origin "https://x:$KEY@$HOST/$ME/web.git"
git push -u origin main
```

Every push and every API call went through `AuthenticatedLive`. The
engine never saw a credential.

## Replacing one of the engine's routes

`gh` validates its credential against `GET /api/v3/user`. The engine
has no user to answer with. Answer with yours by providing another
Layer for the same route, nearer the API than `Git.Handlers`. The
engine's route class does not declare your middleware, so the handler
reads the `Session` as an option:

```typescript
import * as Option from "effect/Option";

export const GitHubUserLive = Git.GitHubUser.make(
  Effect.succeed(() =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const session = yield* Effect.serviceOption(Session);
      const user = Option.isSome(session) ? session.value.user : null;
      if (user === null) {
        return HttpServerResponse.jsonUnsafe(
          { message: "Requires authentication" },
          { status: 401 },
        );
      }
      return HttpServerResponse.jsonUnsafe({
        login: user.id,
        name: user.name ?? user.id,
        type: "User",
      });
    }),
  ),
);
```

```diff lang="typescript"
const GitLive = Git.Server.layer(AppApi).pipe(
-  Layer.provide(MeLive),
+  Layer.provide([MeLive, GitHubUserLive]),
  Layer.provide(Git.Handlers),
```

The nearer implementation wins. Every git route can be replaced this
way, and the group it lives in never knows.

## Your application on the same origin

The application is a front-door Worker that serves your UI and
forwards `/api/**` and the git paths to the host over a service
binding. The session cookie is first-party, clone URLs are on your
domain, and nothing needs CORS:

```typescript
// src/worker.ts
const API = /^\/api\//;
const WIRE = /^\/[^/]+\/[^/]+\/(?:info\/refs$|git-upload-pack$|git-receive-pack$)/;

export default {
  fetch(request: Request, env: { GIT: Fetcher; ASSETS: Fetcher }) {
    const { pathname } = new URL(request.url);
    return API.test(pathname) || WIRE.test(pathname)
      ? env.GIT.fetch(request)
      : env.ASSETS.fetch(request);
  },
};
```

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
const web = yield* Cloudflare.Website.Vite("Web", {
  main: "src/worker.ts",
  domain: "git.example.com",
  assets: { notFoundHandling: "single-page-application", runWorkerFirst: true },
  env: { GIT: GitHost },
});
```

Forward the git paths verbatim. A proxy that buffers request bodies
breaks streaming pushes, and one that rewrites `Host` makes the host
print clone URLs for the wrong domain.

## Where next

You built your own API around the embedded server, and an application
on that API. Every signed-in user can create repositories and push to
their own; [Part 4](/git/tutorial/part-4) lets a team share one, and
writes the rule about which refs may move. The complete app, with a React UI
that signs in and mints keys, is
[examples/cloudflare-git-service](https://github.com/alchemy-run/alchemy/tree/main/examples/cloudflare-git-service).
[Auth](/git/blocks/auth) has the pattern in full, and
[Server](/git/blocks/server) the routes.

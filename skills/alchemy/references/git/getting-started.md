# Getting Started

> Deploy a git host to Cloudflare and push your first repository, in one file. The tutorial then builds the same file from empty.

You need a Cloudflare account with Workers, Durable Objects, and R2
enabled. [Cloudflare setup](/cloudflare/setup) connects one.

## Install

```sh
bun add alchemy
```

## Define the host

```typescript
// src/git.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Git from "alchemy/Git";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";
import * as Redacted from "effect/Redacted";
import * as HttpServerResponse from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerResponse";
import * as HttpApiBuilder from "effect/unstable/httpapi/HttpApiBuilder";
import * as HttpApiMiddleware from "effect/unstable/httpapi/HttpApiMiddleware";
import * as HttpApiSecurity from "effect/unstable/httpapi/HttpApiSecurity";

export const GitObjects = Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("GitObjects");
export const GitSecret = Alchemy.Random("GitSecret");

/** One shared secret, sent as the password of HTTP Basic. */
export class Authenticated extends HttpApiMiddleware.Service<
  Authenticated,
  { requires: Alchemy.RuntimeContext }
>()("Authenticated") {}

export const AuthenticatedLive = Layer.effect(
  Authenticated,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const secret = yield* (yield* GitSecret).text;
    return (httpEffect) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        const { password } = yield* HttpApiBuilder.securityDecode(
          HttpApiSecurity.basic,
        );
        if (Redacted.value(password) === Redacted.value(yield* secret)) {
          return yield* httpEffect;
        }
        return HttpServerResponse.empty({
          status: 401,
          headers: { "www-authenticate": 'Basic realm="git"' },
        });
      });
  }),
);

/** The git API, every route behind the middleware. */
export class Api extends Git.Api.middleware(Authenticated) {}

const GitLive = Git.Server.layer(Api).pipe(
  Layer.provide(Git.Handlers),
  Layer.provide(AuthenticatedLive),
  Layer.provide(Git.ReposDurableObject),
  Layer.provide(Git.RegistryDurableObject),
  Layer.provide(Git.BlobStoreR2(GitObjects)),
  Layer.provide(Git.HasherInline),
);

export default class GitHost extends Cloudflare.Worker<GitHost>()(
  "Git",
  { main: import.meta.url, ...Git.GIT_WORKER_OPTIONS },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const git = yield* Git.Server;
    return { fetch: git.fetch };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(GitLive)),
) {}
```

The engine holds no users and no credentials. Who may call a route is
decided by the middleware of the API that mounts it, and `Git.Api`
mounts every git route: the REST plane, the git wire, the raw reads,
and the GitHub facade. The smallest thing that secures a fresh host is
one shared secret. A request that presents it may do anything; any
other request is refused with a `401` that makes `git` ask for a
password. The secret is an `Alchemy.Random`, minted on the first deploy
and stable after it. `GIT_WORKER_OPTIONS` sets the compatibility flags
and the CPU limit a push needs.

Add the host to your stack. The `Random` is a resource like any other,
so the stack can output its value:

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Output from "alchemy/Output";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as Redacted from "effect/Redacted";
import GitHost, { GitSecret } from "./src/git.ts";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "GitService",
  { providers: Cloudflare.providers(), state: Cloudflare.state() },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const git = yield* GitHost;
    const secret = yield* GitSecret;
    return {
      url: git.url.as<string>(),
      secret: Output.map(secret.text, Redacted.value),
    };
  }),
);
```

## Deploy

```sh
bun alchemy deploy
```

The stack prints the Worker's URL and the secret. The rest of this page
calls them `$HOST` and `$GIT_SECRET`:

```sh
export HOST=...
export GIT_SECRET=...
```

## Create a repository

Repositories are named `owner/name`. The owner is a name you choose;
with one shared secret there are no users behind it:

```sh
curl -u "x:$GIT_SECRET" -X POST "$HOST/api/v1/repos" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"owner":"acme","name":"web"}'
```

## Push

The secret goes in the password field of the remote URL. The username
is ignored:

```sh
git remote add origin "https://x:$GIT_SECRET@$HOST/acme/web.git"
git push -u origin main
```

Clone it back to prove the round trip:

```sh
git clone "https://x:$GIT_SECRET@$HOST/acme/web.git" verify
git -C verify fsck --strict
```

## Continue with the tutorial

The file above is a handful of decisions. The tutorial builds it from
empty, one decision per part, then puts it behind your own API and
your own rules:

1. [A git server in one file](/git/tutorial/part-1) — each block,
   named as you type it.
2. [Repositories](/git/tutorial/part-2) — create, push, make public,
   clone anonymously.
3. [Your own API](/git/tutorial/part-3) — the git routes inside your
   `HttpApi` behind Better Auth, a route of your own, and one of the
   engine's replaced.
4. [Your own rules](/git/tutorial/part-4) — git's pre-receive hook as
   a service: protect `main`, let a team share a repository.

[Building blocks](/git/blocks) is the reference for each line of
`GitLive`, and [Recipes](/git/recipes) covers S3 bytes, Lambda hashing,
and how the host scales.

# Git

> A pluggable, embeddable, self-hostable git server on Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, and R2. Smart HTTP for any client, a typed REST plane with pull requests, and a GitHub-compatible API, assembled in one file.

`alchemy/Git` is a pluggable, embeddable, self-hostable git server. It
speaks git's smart HTTP to any client, serves a typed REST plane with
pull requests, and answers the GitHub REST v3 API for `gh` and Octokit.
It runs on Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, and R2, embeds in your
own `HttpApi`, and each part of it is an Effect Layer you can replace:

```typescript
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Git from "alchemy/Git";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";

export const GitObjects = Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("GitObjects");

const GitLive = Git.Server.layer(Api).pipe( // Api: Git.Api behind your middleware
  Layer.provide(Git.Handlers), // the engine's implementation of every route
  Layer.provide(AuthenticatedLive), // your middleware: who may call what
  Layer.provide(Git.ReposDurableObject), // refs, objects, pull requests
  Layer.provide(Git.RegistryDurableObject), // owner/name → repo
  Layer.provide(Git.BlobStoreR2(GitObjects)), // packs, bundles, large pushes
  Layer.provide(Git.HasherInline), // push verification
);

export default Cloudflare.Worker(
  "Git",
  { main: import.meta.url, ...Git.GIT_WORKER_OPTIONS },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const git = yield* Git.Server;
    return { fetch: git.fetch };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(GitLive)),
);
```

Each line of the graph is one decision with its own implementations.
Changing a line changes the decision and nothing else:

```diff lang="typescript"
const GitLive = Git.Server.layer(Api).pipe(
  Layer.provide(Git.Handlers),
  Layer.provide(AuthenticatedLive),
+  Layer.provide(ProtectedMain),
  Layer.provide(Git.ReposDurableObject),
  Layer.provide(Git.RegistryDurableObject),
-  Layer.provide(Git.BlobStoreR2(GitObjects)),
+  Layer.provide(Git.BlobStoreS3()),
  Layer.provide(Git.HasherInline),
);
```

Bytes now live in S3 and `main` only moves for its owner. A missing
line is a type error.

The engine holds no users, no credentials, and no policy. Who may call
a route is the middleware of the API that mounts it, so the same host
runs behind a shared secret, behind Better Auth, or behind any other
authentication, and which refs may move is git's pre-receive hook as a
service. Every route is a class with a pluggable implementation, so
the host is also an API that can be extended and reshaped one route at
a time.
[git.alchemy.run](https://git.alchemy.run) runs this file. The alchemy
monorepo, 44,051 objects in a 67 MiB pack, is hosted on it and clones
back byte-identical under `git fsck --strict`.

## Build one

[Getting Started](/git/getting-started) deploys the file above and pushes to it in ten
minutes. The tutorial then builds it from an empty file, one decision
per part:

1. [A git server in one file](/git/tutorial/part-1) — each block,
   named as you type it.
2. [Repositories](/git/tutorial/part-2) — create, push, make public,
   clone anonymously.
3. [Your own API](/git/tutorial/part-3) — the git routes inside your
   `HttpApi` behind Better Auth, a route of your own, and one of the
   engine's replaced.
4. [Your own rules](/git/tutorial/part-4) — git's pre-receive hook as
   a service: protect `main`, let a team share a repository.

## Use it

- [Cloning & pushing](/git/clone-and-push) — standard clients, what
  the wire supports, credentials.
- [Repositories](/git/repositories) — create, fork, import, and manage
  over the typed REST plane.
- [Pull requests](/git/pull-requests) — server-side merge base, diffs,
  and merges.
- [GitHub API compatibility](/git/github-api) — `gh api` and Octokit
  against your host.

## Shape it

[Building blocks](/git/blocks) is the reference for each line of the
graph: the contract, what ships, how to write your own.
[Recipes](/git/recipes) maps requirements to lines, with
[Scaling](/git/recipes/scaling) as the why behind the table and complete
stack files to copy.

## Not a GitHub replacement

No issues, reviews, comments, checks, Actions, or GraphQL. `gh api`
works. `gh pr create` and the rest of the porcelain do not. What it is:
a git remote you own, with an API, that you can build on.

Looking for the GitHub *provider*, which manages repos, Actions
secrets, and webhooks on github.com? That is [GitHub](/github).

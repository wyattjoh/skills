| Cloudflare | `_overview.md` | Build and deploy full applications on Cloudflare with Alchemy — one Worker runtime plus resources like Durable Objects, D1, R2, Queues, and Hyperdrive, wired together by typed bindings. |
| Local development | `local-development.md` | alchemy dev runs Workers in workerd with local simulators for KV, R2, D1, Queues, Hyperdrive, Workflows, Containers, and the Worker binding surface — browser rendering, images, email, cron, Stream, and more. |
| Setup | `setup.md` | Install Alchemy, create a Cloudflare account, and connect the two — OAuth or API token, saved to a local profile. No environment variables required. |

## ai/

| Page | File | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add an AI Gateway | `ai/ai-gateway.md` | Wire an AI Gateway into your Worker, turn it into a typed Effect LanguageModel, and run generations and streams through Workers AI with caching, rate limiting, and logs. |
| Add AI Search (AutoRAG) | `ai/ai-search.md` | Stand up a Cloudflare AI Search (AutoRAG) pipeline over an R2 bucket with one Search call, bind it into your Worker as a typed Effect client, and answer questions over your own documents. |

| Build a release-automation agent | `ai/release-agent.md` | Case study of the cloudflare-agent example — GitHub push events routed through a Worker to a per-release Durable Object that drives an AI agent with container-backed tools. |
| Vector search with Vectorize | `ai/vectorize.md` | Create a Vectorize index, bind it to a Worker with SearchIndex, and run filtered nearest-neighbor queries over vector embeddings. |
| Run Workers AI models | `ai/workers-ai.md` | Bind Workers AI into your Worker with Cloudflare.Workers.AI — run inference and list models directly, or turn the binding into a typed Effect LanguageModel, no gateway required. |

## compute/

| Page | File | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add a Workflow | `compute/add-a-workflow.md` | Orchestrate durable, multi-step work with Cloudflare Workflows — automatic retries, replayable steps, and at-least-once delivery. |
| Browser rendering | `compute/browser-rendering.md` | Attach Cloudflare Browser Rendering to a Worker — run quick actions like markdown and scrape, stream screenshots and PDFs, or drive the raw binding with puppeteer. |
| Workers Cache | `compute/cache.md` | Serve responses from Cloudflare's edge cache before your Worker even runs — enable it with one yield, control it with standard headers, purge it by tag from inside a handler. |
| Containers | `compute/containers.md` | Cloudflare Containers run long-lived processes beside a Durable Object — declare a typed container class, implement its runtime in a separate file, and alchemy builds the image, pushes it, and wires the DO pairing. |
| Bind to another Worker's Durable Object | `compute/cross-worker-durable-object.md` | Share a Durable Object across multiple Workers — one Worker hosts the runtime, others bind to it by scriptName for a typed RPC stub — and move the host later with the data intact. |
| Durable Objects | `compute/durable-objects.md` | Durable Objects are globally-unique stateful instances with transactional storage — define one as an Effect, persist state per key, expose typed RPC methods, and stream values back to the caller. |
| Gradual deployments | `compute/gradual-deployments.md` | Roll out Worker deploys incrementally — upload preview versions, canary a percentage of live traffic, ramp to 100%, pin users to a version during the rollout, and verify which version served each request. |
| Accept WebSockets | `compute/hibernatable-websockets.md` | Accept WebSocket connections in a Durable Object, broadcast between peers, and survive Cloudflare's hibernation. |
| Python Workers | `compute/python-workers.md` | Deploy Cloudflare Python Workers by pointing main at a .py file — alchemy uploads the modules, vendors pyproject.toml dependencies with uv, and serves them locally through workerd's built-in Pyodide. |
| Rate limiting | `compute/rate-limiting.md` | Throttle requests inside a Worker with Cloudflare's Rate Limiting binding — declare the limit on the binding, count arbitrary keys at runtime, handle failures as typed errors. |
| Run a Container | `compute/run-a-container.md` | Run a long-lived container alongside a Durable Object, expose RPC methods, and proxy HTTP requests to ports inside the container. |
| Worker Loader | `compute/worker-loader.md` | Load and run ephemeral Workers at runtime from inline source — each in its own sandboxed isolate, with optional outbound-network control and typed RPC entrypoints. |
| Workers for Platforms | `compute/workers-for-platforms.md` | Run your customers' Workers in your own account — create a dispatch namespace, upload user Workers into it, and route requests from a platform Worker with the Get binding. |
| Workers | `compute/workers.md` | Cloudflare Workers are the compute runtime of every alchemy app — define infrastructure and runtime behavior in one Effect program, bind resources with full type safety, and call other Workers over schemaless RPC. |
| Workflows | `compute/workflows.md` | Cloudflare Workflows run durable multi-step jobs — define a typed workflow class, checkpoint steps with task and sleep, trigger instances from a Worker, and poll status until completion. |

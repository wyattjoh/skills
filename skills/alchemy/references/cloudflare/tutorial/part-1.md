# Part 1: Your First Stack

> Install Alchemy, create a Stack with a Cloudflare R2 Bucket, and deploy it.

In this first part you'll install Alchemy and Effect, create a Stack
with a Cloudflare R2 Bucket, and deploy it — all in under five
minutes.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (recommended) or Node.js 22+
- A [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) account

## Create a project

Start with an empty directory and initialize a `package.json`:

```sh
mkdir my-app && cd my-app && bun init -y
```

## Install dependencies

Install <code>alchemy@latest</code> and <code>effect@{effectVersion}</code>:

```sh
bun add "alchemy@latest" "effect@rc" "@effect/platform-bun@rc" "@effect/platform-node@rc"
```

:::tip
We recommend Bun for the best development experience, but Node.js
works too.

## Create the Stack

Every Alchemy program starts with a `Stack` — a collection of
Resources managed by Providers with state tracked between deploys.

Create an `alchemy.run.ts` file:

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  {
  // @error: ts(2345) Argument of type '{ providers: Layer.Layer<never, never, never>; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'StackProps<never>'.
  // @error:   Property 'state' is missing in type '{ providers: Layer.Layer<never, never, never>; }' but required in type 'StackProps<never>'.
    providers: Layer.empty,
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // we'll add resources here next
  }),
);
```

TypeScript is unhappy: the `state` property is required. Every Stack
needs a **state store** so Alchemy can persist resource state between
deploys and compute diffs against your infrastructure.

## Configure state

For this tutorial we'll use `Cloudflare.state()`, which persists state
in a Cloudflare-hosted Worker backed by a Durable Object:

```diff lang="typescript"
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
+import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  {
    providers: Layer.empty,
+    state: Cloudflare.state(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // we'll add resources here next
  }),
);
```

The first time you run `alchemy deploy`, `plan`, or `dev`, Alchemy
will prompt for permission and bootstrap the state-store Worker into
your Cloudflare account. It looks like this:

> Interactive `StateStoreBootstrap` widget; see the live page for its rendered output.

This is a one-time event — the state-store Worker, its Durable
Object, and the Secrets Store entries holding its auth token and
encryption key are reused across every stack and stage on this
Cloudflare account. See [State Store](/state-store) for
the full picture.

:::note[Other state stores]
Don't want to deploy a Worker just for state? Swap `Cloudflare.state()`
for `State.localState()` from `alchemy/State` to keep state on disk
under `.alchemy/`, or [write your own](/state-store).
:::

## Add a Resource

Resources represent cloud infrastructure — buckets, queues, functions,
databases, and so on. Each resource is `yield*`-ed inside the Stack's
Effect generator.

Let's add a Cloudflare R2 Bucket to our Stack and observe the type error:

```diff lang="typescript"
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  {
    providers: Layer.empty,
    // @error: ts(2322) Type 'Layer<never, never, never>' is not assignable to type 'Layer<NoInfer<Providers>, never, StackServices>'.
    // @error:   Type 'Providers' is not assignable to type 'never'.
    state: Cloudflare.state(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
+    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Bucket");
  }),
);
```

TypeScript is telling us that `Layer.empty` doesn't provide
`Cloudflare.Providers` — the layer required by `Bucket`.

## Fix the Providers

Replace `Layer.empty` with `Cloudflare.providers()` to resolve the
type error:

```diff lang="typescript"
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
-import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  {
+    providers: Cloudflare.providers(),
    state: Cloudflare.state(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Bucket");
  }),
);
```

Now the program type-checks. The providers layer tells Alchemy how to
talk to Cloudflare's APIs, and the type system ensures you never
forget to wire it up.

## Return Stack outputs

Stack outputs let you see important values after a deploy. Return an
object from the generator to expose them:

```diff lang="typescript"
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  {
    providers: Cloudflare.providers(),
    state: Cloudflare.state(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Bucket");

+    return {
+      bucketName: bucket.bucketName,
    };
  }),
);
```

## Deploy

Run `alchemy deploy` to create the Bucket on Cloudflare:

```sh
bun alchemy deploy
```

The first time you deploy, Alchemy walks each provider in your stack
through an interactive login and saves the credentials to your
**`default`** [profile](/environments/profiles) at
`~/.alchemy/profiles.json`. For Cloudflare you can sign in with
OAuth in the browser or paste an API token — no environment
variables or `wrangler login` required.

:::tip
To re-run the credential prompt later (e.g. to switch from OAuth to
an API token, or to add a `prod` profile) use
`alchemy login --configure` or
`alchemy login --profile prod --configure`.
:::

```text
Plan: 1 to create
+ Bucket (Cloudflare.R2.Bucket)

Proceed?
◉ Yes ○ No
✓ Bucket (Cloudflare.R2.Bucket) created
{
  bucketName: "myapp-bucket-a1b2c3d4e5",
}
```

Alchemy shows a plan, asks for confirmation, creates the resource,
and prints the stack outputs. Your bucket is live on Cloudflare.

:::tip
By convention, Alchemy looks for `alchemy.run.ts` at the root of your
project. You can specify a different file with
`alchemy deploy <file>`.
:::

## Verify it worked

Your newly created R2 bucket will be listed on the [Cloudflare R2 Object Storage Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/overview).

Run `alchemy deploy` again. Because nothing changed, the bucket shows
as a no-op:

```text
Plan: no changes

{
  bucketName: "myapp-bucket-a1b2c3d4e5",
}
```

This is the core loop — declare resources in code, deploy, and
Alchemy figures out what changed.

## Recap

You now have:

- An `alchemy.run.ts` with a Stack and a Cloudflare R2 Bucket
- A live bucket deployed to your Cloudflare account
- Stack outputs showing the bucket name

In [Part 2](/cloudflare/tutorial/part-2), you'll add a Cloudflare Worker that
uses this bucket to serve HTTP requests.

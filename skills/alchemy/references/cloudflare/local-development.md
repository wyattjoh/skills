# Local development

> alchemy dev runs Workers in workerd with local simulators for KV, R2, D1, Queues, Hyperdrive, Workflows, Containers, and the Worker binding surface — browser rendering, images, email, cron, Stream, and more.

`alchemy dev` runs your Cloudflare stack on your machine. Workers
execute in workerd — the same runtime used in production — with
local simulators behind their bindings, websites run their
frameworks' own dev servers with native HMR, containers run in
Docker, and code changes hot reload in milliseconds.

```sh
alchemy dev
```

```text
✓ Bucket (Cloudflare.R2.Bucket) created (local)
✓ DB (Cloudflare.D1.Database) created (local)
✓ Worker (Cloudflare.Worker) created (local → workerd)
  • http://localhost:1337

## Workers run in workerd

Your Worker code executes in workerd with bindings wired to the
local simulators, so binding behavior matches what you deploy:

```typescript
export const Cache = Cloudflare.KV.Namespace("Cache");

export default class Api extends Cloudflare.Worker<Api>()(
  "Api",
  { main: import.meta.url },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const kv = yield* Cloudflare.KV.ReadWriteNamespace(Cache);
    return {
      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
        yield* kv.put("greeting", "hello");
        const value = yield* kv.get("greeting");
        return yield* HttpServerResponse.text(value ?? "");
      }).pipe(Effect.orDie),
    };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(Cloudflare.KV.ReadWriteNamespaceBinding)),
) {}
```

In dev, `kv.put` lands in a local KV simulator and the Worker
serves at `http://localhost:<port>`. Durable Objects run inside
the same workerd instance, cron triggers fire on their real
schedule (and the miniflare-compatible
`/cdn-cgi/handler/scheduled` route triggers them manually), and
because everything is a local process you can attach a debugger,
set breakpoints, and profile.

A local resource's id is `dev:`-prefixed, which doubles as proof
that no cloud call ran.

## Websites run their own dev servers

Every `Cloudflare.Website.*` resource — Vite, Next.js, Astro,
Nuxt, SvelteKit, Waku, Octane, Foldkit, StaticSite — runs its
framework's own dev server under `alchemy dev`: native HMR, no
cloud resources. The site's `url` is the local dev server's
address:

```typescript
const site = yield* Cloudflare.Website.Vite("Web");
// dev:    site.url = http://localhost:5173 — Vite's own dev server, HMR included
// deploy: site.url = the deployed site
```

See
[Frontend frameworks](/cloudflare/frontend/frontends).

## Containers run in Docker

A `Cloudflare.Container` runs as a real Docker container on your
machine, driven by its Durable Object in the local workerd:

```typescript
export class Sandbox extends Cloudflare.Container<
  Sandbox,
  { ping: () => Effect.Effect<string> }
>()("Sandbox") {}

export default Sandbox.make(
  { main: import.meta.url },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    return Sandbox.of({
      ping: () => Effect.succeed("pong"),
      fetch: Effect.succeed(HttpServerResponse.text("hello")),
    });
  }),
);
```

All three image sources work locally: `main` (a bundled Effect
program), `context` (your own Dockerfile), and `image` (a
pre-built remote image).

## What's emulated

These resources ship a local provider and run as simulators in
dev:

| Resource                 | Local behavior                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workers                  | workerd, with hot reload and a `http://localhost:<port>` URL                       |
| Durable Objects          | run inside the local workerd, including SQLite storage                             |
| KV Namespaces            | local simulator; Node-side capability clients hit the same store                   |
| R2 Buckets               | local simulator                                                                    |
| D1 Databases             | local simulator; `migrations` and `importFiles` apply on every reconcile           |
| Queues + consumers       | local broker with batching, retry, and dead-letter semantics                       |
| Hyperdrive               | connects directly to your database                                                 |
| Workflows                | run locally with real step semantics                                               |
| Containers               | run as Docker containers on your machine                                           |
| Secrets Store            | local store seeded with the real (Redacted-sourced) values                         |
| Websites                 | the framework's own dev server (Vite, Astro, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Waku, Octane, Foldkit, StaticSite) with native HMR |

Worker-only bindings are simulated too:

- **Email, both directions** — a `send_email` binding persists
  messages as `.eml` files under `.alchemy/local/email`, and a
  `POST` to `/cdn-cgi/handler/email` drives your `email()` handler
  with accept, reject, and reply semantics.
- **Browser Rendering** — `env.BROWSER` drives a locally-launched
  headless Chrome over CDP; `@cloudflare/puppeteer` works
  unchanged.
- **Images** — `env.IMAGES` transforms run through sharp.
- **Stream** — uploads land in a local video store.
- **Tail consumers** — a local producer's trace events reach a
  local tail Worker.
- **Secret keys** — `secret_key` CryptoKey bindings boot locally.
- **Access** — `dev: { access: { identity } }` stubs the
  authenticated identity behind `ctx.access`, so gated paths are
  testable without a login wall. See
  [Protect a Worker with Access](/cloudflare/security/access).

Resources whose provider has no local implementation (a Vectorize
index, DNS records) deploy to the real cloud, into your personal
[stage](/environments/stages), so a stack that mixes emulated and
live-only resources just works.

## Mix in the real cloud

`Alchemy.remote()` opts any resource (or a whole scope) out of
local emulation:

```typescript
// Effect-native Worker
const browser = yield* Cloudflare.Browser("BROWSER").pipe(Alchemy.remote());

// async Worker env
env: { IMAGES: Cloudflare.Images.Images("IMAGES").pipe(Alchemy.remote()) }
```

Local and live compose into hybrid topologies. Pin a queue live
and everything around it stays local — the local Worker produces
real messages into the real queue, and its local consumer drains
the same queue through a pull loop:

```typescript
// the queue is real, even in dev
const Jobs = Cloudflare.Queues.Queue("Jobs").pipe(Alchemy.remote());
```

Your dev session sees the same traffic as staging — messages
produced by deployed services or a teammate's session land in
your local handler.

Switching a resource between local and live (or dev → deploy)
plans a **replacement** — dev state never silently becomes cloud
state. See
[Local development](/environments/local-development) for the
shared semantics.

## Custom port

```typescript
export default Cloudflare.Worker("Worker", {
  main: import.meta.url,
  dev: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  // ...
});
```

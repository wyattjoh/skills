# What is Alchemy?

> Alchemy is Infrastructure as Code built in pure Effect, with Infrastructure as Effects on top. Declare your cloud resources and the code that runs on them in one type-safe TypeScript program, and deploy it with one command.

Alchemy is **Infrastructure as Code** built in pure
[Effect](https://effect.website), with **Infrastructure as Effects**
on top. Infrastructure as Code declares, diffs, and deploys cloud
resources the way Terraform or Pulumi does. Infrastructure as Effects
lets the code that runs on those resources live in the same program,
as typed Effects and Layers.

Here is the whole thing in one file. An R2 Bucket, and a Worker that
serves files from it:

```typescript
// src/api.ts
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as HttpServerResponse from "effect/unstable/http/HttpServerResponse";

export const Uploads = Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Uploads");

export default Cloudflare.Worker(
  "Api",
  { main: import.meta.url },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(Uploads);

    return {
      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
        const obj = yield* bucket.get("hello.txt");
        return obj
          ? HttpServerResponse.text(yield* obj.text())
          : HttpServerResponse.text("Not found", { status: 404 });
      }),
    };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucketBinding)),
);
```

That one file is a complete application. The Bucket is declared next
to the Worker that uses it, and `bucket` is a typed client the handler
closes over. Let's start with Infrastructure as Code, then look at what
Infrastructure as Effects adds on top.

## Infrastructure as Code

The core of Alchemy is Infrastructure as Code, in the same family as
Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation, and the CDK. A **Stack** is the
unit you deploy, an Effect that yields resources and returns the
outputs you want printed:

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import Api from "./src/api.ts";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyApp",
  { providers: Cloudflare.providers(), state: Cloudflare.state() },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const api = yield* Api;
    return { url: api.url };
  }),
);
```

Deploy it:

```sh
bun alchemy deploy
```

Alchemy creates the Bucket, bundles the Worker, wires the binding
between them, and prints the URL. Every deploy targets a stage, an isolated environment with its own
copy of every resource, so `dev` and `prod` never touch each other:

```sh
alchemy deploy              # dev_$USER by default
alchemy deploy --stage prod
```

Alchemy reads the current state, diffs it against your program, shows
the plan, and applies it in dependency order. Here is that loop for a
Stack with a Bucket, a KV Namespace, and a Worker bound to both:

<DeployTerminal client:visible />

`state` is where the result persists between runs, so the next deploy
only touches what changed. [Stacks](/infrastructure-as-code/stack)
covers stages, outputs, and state.

A **Resource** is a cloud entity in a Stack managed by Alchemy: a
bucket, a database, a queue, a Worker, a DNS record. Declare it, then
yield it in the Stack to add it to the plan:

```typescript
export const Uploads = Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Uploads");

const bucket = yield* Uploads; // bucket.bucketName is an Output
```

Each Resource has a logical id, `"Uploads"` here, that Alchemy uses to
track it across deploys. Its outputs are typed values you can pass
into other Resources. Here the physical bucket name Alchemy generated
becomes an environment variable on a Worker:

```typescript
const bucket = yield* Uploads;

yield* Cloudflare.Worker("Api", {
  main: "./src/api.ts",
  env: { BUCKET_NAME: bucket.bucketName },
});
```

:::note
[Resources](/infrastructure-as-code/resource) covers props, outputs,
and references between Resources.
:::

A **Provider** teaches Alchemy how to read, diff, create, update, and
delete one resource type. Each cloud ships its providers as an Effect
Layer, and a Stack takes as many as it needs:

```typescript
providers: Layer.mergeAll(Cloudflare.providers(), AWS.providers()),
```

The type system checks the wiring. Yield an AWS resource in a Stack
that only provides `Cloudflare.providers()` and the program does not
compile. [Providers](/infrastructure-as-code/provider) covers the
built-in ones, and
[Custom Provider](/infrastructure-as-code/custom-provider) shows how
to write your own.

## A superset of Infrastructure as Code

With only Infrastructure as Code, Alchemy looks like and functions like any other
IaC tool. One file
declares the Bucket and the Worker, passing the Bucket on the Worker's
`env`. Another file is the handler, reaching for the Bucket through
that env:

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";

export const Uploads = Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Uploads");

export const Api = Cloudflare.Worker("Api", {
  main: "./src/api.ts",
  env: { Uploads },
});

export type ApiEnv = Cloudflare.InferEnv<typeof Api>;
```

```typescript
// src/api.ts
import type { ApiEnv } from "../alchemy.run.ts";

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: ApiEnv) {
    const obj = await env.Uploads.get("hello.txt");
    return obj
      ? new Response(await obj.text())
      : new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
  },
};
```

This works, and it is fully supported. `InferEnv` even types the env
from the declaration, which is more than most IaC tools give you. But
the two files are still held together by the name `Uploads`, and the
handler knows nothing about how the Bucket got there. Infrastructure
as Effects is what turns those two files into the one at the top of
this page.

:::tip
Alchemy also supports circular references in the
dependency graph, which most IaC tools reject. See
[Circular Bindings](/infrastructure-as-effects/circular-bindings).
:::

## Infrastructure as Effects

Infrastructure as Effects is what Alchemy adds on top of
Infrastructure as Code.
A **Runtime** is a Resource that carries the code it runs: a Worker, Lambda Function, Container, or Server.
That code is always written the same way, as an **Effectful
Constructor**. Bind what you need, then return what you expose:

```typescript
Effect.gen(function* () {
  // bind what you need
  const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(Uploads);

  // return what you expose
  return { fetch: /* ... */ };
});
```

The outer Effect is the Construction phase. It runs at deploy time,
where the bindings are recorded, and again at cold start, where they
become live clients. What it returns is the Runtime phase, the handlers
that run per request. A Worker returns `fetch`, a Durable Object
returns its RPC methods, a Workflow returns its run function, and
every Runtime in Alchemy is a variation on that one shape.

:::note
[Runtime](/infrastructure-as-effects/runtime) covers the shape, the
`fetch` and RPC interface, and the three ways to declare one.
:::

`yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(Uploads)` is a **Binding**. It
hands back a typed client and generates whatever that client needs to
work. On Cloudflare that is a native Worker binding. On AWS it is an
IAM statement scoped to one resource, plus the resource's name in the
Function's environment:

```typescript
const getItem = yield* AWS.DynamoDB.GetItem(Jobs);
// → { Action: ["dynamodb:GetItem"], Resource: [Jobs.tableArn] }
// → Jobs_tableName=Jobs-a1b2c3
```

There is no `env.Uploads` to reach for and no hand-written policy. The
binding is the SDK.

:::note
[Bindings](/infrastructure-as-effects/binding) follows one binding
through the permissions, configuration, and client it generates.
:::

A Binding is a contract plus a **Layer** that implements it, which is
why `ReadWriteBucketBinding` can be swapped for `ReadWriteBucketHttp`
without touching the handler. The same split works for services of
your own. Put resources and bindings behind a service, and the handler
depends on the service alone:

```typescript
Effect.gen(function* () {
  const jobs = yield* JobService;

  return {
    fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
      return HttpServerResponse.json(yield* jobs.getJob("job-1"));
    }),
  };
}).pipe(Effect.provide(JobServiceKV))
```

Provide `JobServiceKV` and a KV Namespace is created and bound.
Provide a DynamoDB-backed Layer and a Table is instead. The handler
doesn't change.

:::note
[Layers](/infrastructure-as-effects/layers) builds one from scratch,
and the [Infrastructure as Effects](/infrastructure-as-effects)
overview puts the three ideas together.
